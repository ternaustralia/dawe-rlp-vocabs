    a skos:Concept ;
    dcterms:description "Theoretically, it is useful to consider the complete set of plants belonging to all species living in a particular place and time as plant community (community sensu lato see Vellend 2016). In practice, studies often focus on a subset of the whole plant community chosen on the basis of growth form, taxonomy or particular interactions (Morin 2011)." ;
