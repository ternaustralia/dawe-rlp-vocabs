    a skos:Concept ;
    dcterms:description "Plant occurrence can be used to describe the distribution and abundance of plants within a population or community, and it is often used in studies of plant populations and communities. Plant occurrence can be influenced by many factors, such as environmental conditions, competition for resources, and interactions with other species. Plant occurrence is an important concept in plant ecology because it provides information about the distribution and abundance of plants in a given area, which can help to understand the dynamics of plant populations and communities." ;
    skos:definition "In the context of plant ecology, plant occurrence typically refers to the presence of a single plant or a group of plants of the same species in a specific area." ;
    skos:example "1) A clump of grass sampled at a point intercept along a transect; 2) An individual tree sampled along a transect. 3) An Ironbark population on State Forest. 4) A plant in Kakadu National Park in the dry season of 2020." ;
