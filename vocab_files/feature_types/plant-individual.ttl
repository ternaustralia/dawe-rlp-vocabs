    dcterms:description "In ecology, plant individuals are often studied as part of a plant community, which is a group of plant species living and interacting with one another in a specific location. Plant individuals are important components of ecological systems because they are primary producers, meaning that they are able to convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis, and provide food and habitat for other organisms." ;
