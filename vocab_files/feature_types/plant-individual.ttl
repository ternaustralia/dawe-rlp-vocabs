    dcterms:description "In ecology, plant individuals are often studied as part of a plant community, which is a group of plant species living and interacting with one another in a specific location. Plant individuals are important components of ecological systems because they are primary producers, meaning that they are able to convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis, and provide food and habitat for other organisms." ;

    skos:definition "In ecological terms, a plant individual is a single, physically distinct organism belonging to the plant kingdom. This can refer to a single plant, such as a tree or shrub, or a single member of a plant species, such as a single blade of grass or a single leaf." ;
    skos:example "In the TERN vocab collection 'plant individual' is specifically used as a feature of interest representing an individual plant (i.e., either a tree, shrub or palm) in a given geographic location, and is tagged with a unique identification label with repeated observations/measurements such as plant height, stem diamter, etc. perfomed on that individual over time." ;
