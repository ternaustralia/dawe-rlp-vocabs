    dcterms:description "Theoretically, it is useful to consider the complete set of animals belonging to all species living in a particular place and time as an animal community (community sensu lato see Vellend 2016). In practice, studies often focus on a subset of the whole animal community chosen on the basis of growth, taxonomy or particular interactions (Morin 2011)." ;
