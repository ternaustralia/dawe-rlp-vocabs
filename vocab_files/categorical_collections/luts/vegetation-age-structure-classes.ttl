    urnp:conceptDefinition "Trees: Dominated by mature plants particularly in the dominant stratum; evidence of senescence in many plants, some without obvious links to disturbance. Tree crowns show signs of contracting: dead branches and decreased crown diameter and leaf area. Distorted branches and burls may be common. Dead trees may be present; Shrubs: Dominated by old plants (thick stems and primary branches, with increasing dead wood or thin and open if species sheds dead branches), particularly in the dominant stratum. Many senescent plants, some without obvious links to disturbance; Grasses and herbs: In largely annual vegetation, reproduction is complete, and plants are dying or mostly dead; in perennial vegetation, plants have lost vigour, are breaking down; perennial grass base choked with old/brown tiller bases. Litter accumulation may be high; Cryptograms: Clear evidence of the degeneration of plants or clumps; dead older parts of plants may be conspicuous." ;

If large emergent plants are present, then they occupy <5% crown cover of the dominant stratum; if >5%, classesify as ‘uneven age’; Grasses and herbs: Vegetative growth abundant; plants approaching full mature size but reproductive material absent or in early stages only; soil surface largely obscured in average sites; Cryptograms: Cover of plants high for the site; some reproduction may be evident." ;
