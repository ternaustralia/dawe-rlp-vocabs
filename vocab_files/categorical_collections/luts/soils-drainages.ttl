Precipitation is the main source if available water storage capacity is high; but surface subflow and/or groundwater contribute as available water storage capacity decreases. Soils have a wide range in texture and depth. Some horizons may be mottled and/or have orange or rusty linings of root channels; and are wet for several weeks." ;

    urnp:conceptDefinition "Refers to the soil drainage type. Under a very poorly drained soil, water is removed from the soil so slowly that the watertable remains at or near the surface for most of the year. Surface flow; groundwater and subsurface flow are major sources of water; although precipitation may be important where there is a perched watertable and precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration. Soils have a wide range in texture and depth; and often occur in depressed sites. Strong gleying and accumulation of surface organic matter are usually features of most soils." ;

Under a moderately-well drained soil, water is removed from the soil somewhat slowly in relation to supply; due to low permeability; shallow watertable; lack of gradient; or some combination of these. Soils are usually medium to fine in texture. Significant additions of water by subsurface flow are necessary in coarse-textured soil. Some horizons may remain wet for as long as one week after water addition." ;
