    skos:definition "A Berlese funnel is a tool used in ecology to collect and analyze small invertebrates, such as mites and springtails, from soil or leaf litter. Berlese funnel types include standard Berlese funnels, modified Berlese funnels, and automated Berlese funnels. Standard Berlese funnels are the most basic type, consisting of a funnel, mesh screen, and heat source. Modified Berlese funnels are similar, but may have additional features such as a cooling system or a built-in light source. Automated Berlese funnels are more advanced and may include automated sampling, sorting, and counting systems." ;
