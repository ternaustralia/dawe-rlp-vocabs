other modules have been completed), at fauna plots (where other fauna
based modules have been completed), or at 2 ha biodiversity plots

<h3 id="pre-requisites-2">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plot must be established using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Layout and Selection
Module</a> prior to, or during the reconnaissance survey of the Active plot
search protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> must be completed prior to, or during
the reconnaissance survey the Active search protocol.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-2">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey activity time estimates will vary depending on the number and
variety of damage encountered. As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1–2 hours hour for survey planning.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20–60 minutes per plot to complete the reconnaissance visit
and set up the plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 15 minutes for the survey set-up before commencing each
survey to enter the information.</p></li>
<li><p>For 40 x 40 m subplots, allow 30–90 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>For 1 ha plots, allow a minimum of 60 minutes of survey effort
per plot (i.e., 30 minutes for two observers).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-2">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Personnel number and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Within-plot belt transects are best conducted with two personnel,
one making the observations and one recording the data directly into the
app.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor making the observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying the characteristic identifiable features of
the target species signs and how to distinguish these signs from other
species. If surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to
practising, using field reference guides, and seeking advice before
conducting this protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Within-plot belt transects do not involve interference with
wildlife. Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals
are unlikely to be required, but remember to always check with your
local authority. Access permissions are required.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="instructions-and-procedures">Instructions and procedures</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="pre-survey-planning-2">Pre-survey
planning</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Familiarise yourself with the ecology and fauna present within
the project area.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Assess the presence of focal shrub species (e.g. highly
palatable) within the project area.</p></li>
<li><p>If there are target species for the project, assess the target
species’ behaviour (e.g. elusive, utilises roads/tracks) and
ecology.</p></li>
<li><p>If there are target species for the project, determine the
species’ habitat use preferences (e.g. dense vegetation, rugged terrain)
to aid with site selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Assess access (e.g. vehicle tracks), terrain and vegetation of
the project area.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Decide on the most appropriate survey design (e.g. belt
transects, active search plots, or a combination), and select survey
sites.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure suitably experienced field staff and all necessary
equipment is available and operational.</p></li>
<li><p>Assess weather forecasts to ensure conditions are suitable. If
surveys are to be repeated over multiple days, ideally, the weather
should be similar for each survey.</p></li>

set-up</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Arrive at the plot and traverse the plot to assess vegetation
cover, density, substrate, and signs of herbivory or physical damage.
Determine the size of the plot that will be surveyed given the survey
design, and time permitted.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>If using an external GNSS/GPS, ensure it is turned on and
connected to the mobile/tablet.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the Monitor app and select <em>Herbivory and Physical Damage
Module &gt; Active plot search protocol</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>existing plot</em> from the plot status and select
the <em>plot code</em> from the list provided.</p></li>
<li><p>Unless the Plot Description Module has been completed recently,
complete at least the Standard protocol (i.e. if the plot has not been
described in the last six months), or consider the Enhanced protocol if
it has been longer than six months.</p></li>
<li><p>Indicate if <em>survey intent</em> is a once-off measure,
repeated measure, or linked to a pre-control activity or post-control
activity (optional).</p></li>
<li><p>Indicate the <em>target species</em> for the survey (cat, fox,
wild dog, rabbit, deer species, goat, pig, horse, camel, other).
Multiple species can be selected. If other is selected, enter the pest
species name. If there are no target species for this project, select
<em>not applicable.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Enter the <em>number of observers</em>, <em>observer name</em>
and <em>observer role</em> (spotter, data entry, data entry only) for
each observer.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the size of the plot that will be surveyed (40 x 40 m
subplot or 100 x 100 m plot).</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>The subplot method requires all instances of herbivory and
physical damage to be recorded.</p></li>

and physical damage type.</p></li>
