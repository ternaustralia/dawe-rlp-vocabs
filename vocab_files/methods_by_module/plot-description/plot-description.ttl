<p>This module covers the procedures and guidelines to collect plot
description information, including landform, slope, aspect and
disturbance, as well as a vegetation description to NVIS Level 5
(dominant species present in each strata). The procedures align with
national guidelines for surveying land and vegetation, including the
<em>Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook</em> (The National
Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009), the <em>Guidelines for Surveying
Soil and Land Resources</em> (McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008) and NVIS
(NVIS Technical Working Group 2017).</p>
<p>This module has links to the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics module</a></em> – The species names or field names used
for the NVIS Level 5 description in this module need to align with the
names assigned in the floristics module. The floristics module should be
completed before the plot description information is collected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover module</a></em> – NVIS Level 5 information is also collected
within the <em>Cover</em> module using the point-intercept method (more
detailed approach), but it is vital that this information is also
collected as part of the <em>Plot Description</em> module, particularly
at plots where the cover module is not undertaken. The NVIS Level 5
description generated in this module can be cross-checked against the
NVIS description generated from the <em>Cover</em> module.</p>
</li>

<p><em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/05669173-2fe7-4b70-ba67-2e09fbe87de9">Photo Points module</a></em> – A static photo is taken at each plot
and this provides a visual representation of the area and is
complementary to the plot description information. The plot photo should
capture any defining features described in this module including
landform and vegetation type.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<th><strong>Plot</strong></th>
<th>The specific survey area where information is collected (generally
100 m x 100 m; 1 ha). Final plot location is determined in the field,
with preference given to homogeneous areas representative of the broader
project area, with a constant mix of vegetation, relief and soil.</th>
</tr>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Landform Pattern</strong></th>
<th>Landform patterns have dimensions of approximately 600 m and are
based on the following attributes – relief, slope (most common), stream
channel occurrence, geomorphological attributes and component landform
elements. Landform patterns generally have longer histories than
landform elements. There are approximately 40 different landform
patterns that occur in Australia (drop-down list – Landform Pattern
Summary).</th>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<th><strong>Landform Element</strong></th>
<th>Landform elements have a dimension of approximately 40 m but can
vary from a few metres to 100 m. A landform element is described by the
following attributes – slope, morphological type, dimensions,
geomorphological activity and geomorphological agent. Landform elements
make up a mosaic within landform patterns. There are approximately 80
different landform elements that occur in Australia (drop-down list –
Landform Element Summary).</th>
</tr>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>NVIS</strong></th>
<th>National Vegetation Information System – a comprehensive data system
that provides information on the extent and distribution of vegetation
types across Australia, and defines how vegetation associations should
be classified. The framework was developed to enable the compilation of
a nationally consistent dataset, produced based on data collected at the
state and territory level. The NVIS is hierarchical and different levels
in the classification provide a description of the vegetation from class
to sub-association that can be directly related to spatially defined
areas.</th>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<th><strong>Relief</strong></th>
<th>The difference in elevation between the high and low points of a
land surface.</th>
</tr>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Slope</strong></th>
<th>The rise or fall of the land surface, which is measured in degrees
using a clinometer. Slope should be measured over a distance of at least
20 m, to reduce influence of any microrelief changes.</th>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<th><strong>Aspect</strong></th>
<th>Identifies the downslope direction (orientation) of the slope. The
reading is taken looking down the slope. Due north is recorded as 360
degrees. Aspect can only have a value of 1 to 360 degrees. A value of 0
indicates that there is no slope.</th>

<th><strong>Surface Strew Size</strong></th>
<th>Size of any surface stones or rocks in millimetres. The size is
recorded using three size classes: Pebble (5-50 mm), Cobble (51-250 mm)
and Boulder (&gt; 250 mm).</th>

    <h4 id="landform-and-land-surface">Landform and Land Surface </h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plot description information should be collected at the end of the
plot survey when the observer is familiar with the landscape and plant
species have been identified or assigned a field name in the
<em>Floristics</em> Module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an overview and short description of the different landform and
lithology classes refer to the <em>Landform and Land Surface
Resources</em> at the end of this module or click on the <em>info</em>
buttons within the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The slope class is derived from the degree value entered and is
automatically populated by the app. Slope class can help inform landform
element, so slope information should be collected before the landform
element field is populated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slope can be measured with a clinometer, a compass or a suitable app.
Refer to the supporting <em>Landform and Land Surface Resources</em>
information at the end of this module for tips on measuring slope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If down slope is measured, slope and aspect can be recorded from the
same position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If using a clinometer, ensure that slope is recorded in degrees and
not as a percent. Slope should be measured as precisely as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aspect is the orientation of the down slope and can be recorded to
the nearest 5 or 10 degrees. Refer to the supporting <em>Landform and
Land Surface Resources</em> information at the end of this module for
information on measuring aspect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the observer is not confident in determining lithology in the
field, this information can be sourced from relevant spatial datasets
for the region. This information should be reviewed before the field
survey and a copy taken to the field to assist with the lithology
classification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To assist with lithology classification, refer to the info buttons
within the app, which include photos for all the different lithology
types.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="vegetation">Vegetation </h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vegetation structural information is derived from the dominant growth
form, height and cover for the association. Refer to the <em>Vegetation
Resources</em> at the end of this module for a matrix of all potential
options. All options are listed in the drop-down menu. If unsure, assign
after the Structural Formation once the NVIS Level 5 description has
been completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The homogeneity measure is a record of the visual estimate (in
metres) of the shortest distance from the plot centre to a vegetation
association different to the one being sampled. Where there is
uncertainty, it is recommended that this measure be an underestimate
(better to be conservative when estimating the distance).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where it is not possible to directly observe the distance to a
different association (e.g. goes over dune crest), estimate the furthest
distance that you are sure is within the same association (i.e. as far
as you can still see the vegetation association from the point you are
standing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vegetation information is collected that is consistent with the
association level (Level 5) of the NVIS. Enter up to three dominant
species for each stratum, where present. Information does not need to be
entered for all species or all stratum. For example, if the association
only has two dominant ground storey species and no upper or mid storey,
then information only needs to be entered for G<sub>1</sub> and
G<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refer to the supporting <em>Vegetation Resources</em> information,
which includes vegetation structural diagrams for different vegetation
communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a list of growth forms, height classes and cover codes, refer to
the <em>Vegetation Resources</em> at the end of this module or click on
the info button within the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following growth forms are allowed for each stratum:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upper – trees, tree mallee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle – shrubs, low trees, mallee shrubs, tall grasses, grass
trees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ground – grasses, forbs, rushes, sedges, lichens, low shrubs, ferns,
grass trees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only species that fall into the growth forms associated with each
stratum will be available in the drop-down list for that layer (i.e.
only species classified as trees or tree mallees can be selected from
the upper story species lists).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the NVIS information has been entered based on individual
species and stratum, the app (or database) will generate the NVIS Level
5 description. It is good practice to review this description and if
needed, make any amendments to the data entered, before clicking
<em>Save</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If necessary, you can amend the vegetation information after clicking
<em>Save</em> by using the <em>Edit</em> function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NVIS Level 5 description can be cross-checked against the
association descriptions from the <em>Cover</em> module</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A clinometer is the most efficient method for recording slope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand so you are facing directly up or down the slope. We recommend
measuring the degrees of the downhill slope. If there is no slope, then
record this as 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep both eyes open and align the clinometer cross hairs with the
target point in the distance. To minimise the influence of micro-relief
on the slope reading, the slope measurement should be taken across a
distance of at least 20 m.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The clinometer should be angled so that a consistent height above the
ground is maintained (i.e. measure eye level of another field member
standing at least 20 m away or an object that is approximately the same
height above the ground as eye level).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two scales appear through the clinometer lens (degrees and percent).
Record the degrees in the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a clinometer is not available, slope can also be measured with a
compass (some compasses are also fitted with a clinometer) or a suitable
app (such as Simple Inclinometer, Inclinometer).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Recording aspect using a compass</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aspect is the direction that a slope faces and is recorded in the
downslope direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand so you are facing directly down the middle of the slope and
record the compass bearing (a value from 1 to 360).</p></li>

<li>
<p>If there is no slope, then aspect will be 0, if you are facing due
north then the reading will be 360 degrees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the compass bearing against the diagram below (i.e. if you are
working on an east facing slope, then the degrees should fall between
ca. 68 and 112). </p>

    <h4 id="rationale">Rationale</h4>
    <p>The use of standardised terminology for the collection of plot
information ensures plots are described in a consistent manner across
projects and locations, and this facilitates the development of
comprehensive datasets that can be used more widely (The National
Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009) and that are FAIR
(<strong>F</strong>indable, <strong>A</strong>ccessible,
<strong>I</strong>nteroperable, <strong>R</strong>eusable; (Wilkinson
<em>et al.</em> 2016)). Collecting consistent information regarding the
physical environment of plots can improve understanding of interactions
between the environment and vegetation, capture important information
about the landform under survey and allow plot summary data to be
compared between different sites and across projects (Heard and Channon
1997; Brocklehurst <em>et al.</em> 2007; The National Committee on Soil
and Terrain 2009).</p>
<p>The use of standardised methods to classify vegetation across a range
of different projects ensures consistent, cross jurisdictional
vegetation classification, improves vegetation classification in
data-poor areas, and allows comparison of data across regions, and under
different disturbance, management and climatic regimes (Guerin <em>et
al.</em> 2017; Baruch <em>et al.</em> 2018). The classification of
vegetation associations based on associations between floristic and
structural data is vital to inform biodiversity planning and management,
including natural resources management, environmental impact
assessments, and conservation and restoration projects. Furthermore,
vegetation classification is integral to Australian biodiversity laws
and regulations (Brocklehurst <em>et al.</em> 2007; Cleary <em>et
al.</em> 2015; Freeman <em>et al.</em> 2015; Gellie <em>et al.</em>
2018).</p>
<p>The NVIS framework is the nationally adopted method for classifying
and mapping native vegetation in Australia and provides a comprehensive
way of describing and representing vegetation types based on structural
and floristic measures (NVIS Technical Working Group 2017). Aligning
with the NVIS ensures that vegetation data is collected in a consistent
way, and allows inclusion into state and national databases, as well as
comparisons across plots and projects.</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;

    <h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
    <p>The <em>Plot Description</em> module records basic physical
information about the plot, including landform, slope and aspect,
lithology, disturbance, climate, fire history and vegetation type. The
information collected aligns with national guidelines from the
<em>Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook</em> (also known as
the Yellow Book; The National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009),
<em>Guidelines for Surveying Soil and Land Resources</em> (also known as
the Blue Book; McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008) and the National
Vegetation Information System (NVIS) <em>Australian Vegetation Attribute
Manual</em> (NVIS Technical Working Group 2017), as well as a number of
state and territory guidelines.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this program, a plot is considered an area of land
representative of the landform, vegetation and land surfaces present
within a project area (The National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009).
Plot locations are generally determined by a two-step process, which
involves a desktop assessment to define areas of interest, followed by a
field assessment to select final plot locations based on areas with a
constant mix of vegetation, slope, relief and soil (Michaels 2006; White
<em>et al.</em> 2012; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015; Freeman <em>et al.</em>
2015). As a standard, plots are 100 m by 100 m (1 ha) in size, but in
some cases plot shape may need to be altered to align with landscape
features such as a dune crest or watercourse (White <em>et al.</em>
2012).</p>
<p>Landform information is generally collected using landform pattern
and landform element components. The key determinants of landform
pattern are relief, stream occurrence, lithology and soil, while slope,
aspect and the position along the slope (toposequence) are key
determinants of landform element (Heard and Channon 1997; McKenzie
<em>et al.</em> 2008; The National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009).
There are approximately 40 landform patterns defined for Australia (see
drop-down list), and approximately 80 landform elements (see drop-down list),
which form a mosaic within landform patterns (The National Committee on
Soil and Terrain 2009). A variety of land surface attributes are also
measured for each plot, including slope, aspect, surface strew size and
lithology. Slope and aspect record the degree and orientation of the
slope respectively (Heard and Channon 1997). Surface strew size and
lithology provide an indication of the size of any surface stones and
the dominant rock type of any surface strew and outcrop (Heard and
Channon 1997; Brocklehurst <em>et al.</em> 2007; McKenzie <em>et
al.</em> 2008).</p>
<p>Vegetation is generally classified based on attributes including the
floristic composition, vertical and horizontal structure, plant
morphology and condition (De Cáceres 2013). Assigning a vegetation
classification consistent with Level 5 (association) of the NVIS
provides a simple, consistent description of the vegetation and its
structural complexity (White <em>et al.</em> 2012). The NVIS is the
Commonwealth system that defines how vegetation communities are
classified and described across the country. The framework was developed
to enable the compilation of a nationally consistent dataset, produced
from data collected at the state and territory level (NVIS Technical
Working Group 2017). At Level 5, the dominant growth form, height, cover
and species (to a maximum of 3 species) are recorded for each of the
three main strata (Upper, Mid and Ground; NVIS Technical Working Group
2017). A homogeneity measure (an estimate of the shortest distance from
the survey point to the boundary of the vegetation association) is also
collected to assist with vegetation classification and mapping (Sparrow
<em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>
<p>Supporting information, including growth stage, climate, disturbance
and fire history provides an indication of the reliability of the
vegetation data in terms of species diversity and the abundance of
seasonal vegetation (which depends on preceding rainfall and other
weather conditions), and helps document other pressures on the
vegetation such as grazing (Heard and Channon 1997; Brocklehurst <em>et
al.</em> 2007; McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008; Casson <em>et al.</em>
2009). Collecting this description information provides the context
needed for the analysis of data collected using a variety of other
methods at the plot level.</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
