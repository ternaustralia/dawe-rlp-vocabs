<h2 id="field-collection-4">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites-2">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plot must be established using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout Module</a> prior to conducting the Device panorama protocol. The centre
position must be marked with a star-dropper.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-2">Time requirements</h3>
<p>The time to complete the photopoints using the Device panorama
protocol will vary depending on the user's skill level and experience
using the camera. The density of the vegetation will influence the time
taken to locate the centre post. As a general guide, for each plot:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1 hour before the survey to pack the required equipment and
check everything is functional, batteries are charged and the
appropriate memory/SD cards are clear.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20 minutes to take the equipment to the centre post, mark
out the triangle.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 10 minutes to take the three panoramas.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 10 – 20 minutes to pack up the tripod, tape measures, and
store equipment safely.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-2">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Photopoints is best conducted with two personnel but can be
conducted by just one.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor should be familiar with and experienced in the
operation of the camera. If surveyors are not confident, time should be
dedicated to practising, using instruction manuals, and seeking advice
before conducting this protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking photos does not involve interference with wildlife.
Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are unlikely
to be required but always check with your local authority. Access
permissions are required.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>The photos should be taken between 10 am and 4 pm (where
possible) to minimise sun and shadow effects on the photos and to ensure
good illumination. It may be appropriate to take photos outside these
times if there is good light, and the light is diffused (i.e. consistent
cloud cover). Overcast conditions are favourable.</p></li>
<li><p>In some communities where the vegetation is very dense, it may
not be possible to obtain useful panoramas as the vegetation is in close
proximity to the camera giving little or no depth to the photo. Still
take the panoramas, but also take other photos of the plot, including
representative photos in cardinal compass directions (in the sequence of
due north, south, east, west) of the community as a reference for the
plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Photopoint centre post locations can be adjusted to suit the
vegetation and terrain. See <a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1.</a>for instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid taking photos with people in the background.</p></li>

for sloping ground – when the horizon is not horizontal</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking a series of photos to form a panorama is difficult when
the plot is on sloping ground. The following adjustments are recommended
and take note these do take some practice.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Instead of holding the device straight at the same angle
throughout the entire sweep and trying to follow a would-be flat
horizon, adjust the angle of which the device is being held, by angling
it downwards for downslope, and upwards for upslope. Another way is to
visualise that you are trying to aim at keeping the device camera
looking towards the trees in the background at the height of 1.3 m.
Adjust the angle of the camera so that you are looking at the 1.3 m
mark, rather than moving higher up the trunk or lower down the
trunk.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="post-field-survey-2">Post-field survey</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Photos must not be edited, cropped, or have watermarks or filters
applied.</p></li>
<li><p>File names should not be re-named from the default camera name
assigned.</p></li>
<li><p>Properties/EXIF metadata of the photos should not be edited, i.e.
date, time and GPS locations (if applicable), should not be altered
with, however additional data may be added.</p></li>

photopoint for the first time</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The centre of the plot should have been established in the Plot
Positioning and Layout Module. If it was not established, use the module
to complete the layout step. Note that whilst ideal, the centre post
does not have to be precisely at the plot centre. There will be times
when the post will need to be re-positioned to allow for trees, dense
vegetation that would not allow for any useful photos, or rocky terrain
that would not allow for the post to be positioned. The re-positioned
location should not be more than 10 m from the plot centre.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Position a central star dropper so that one rib faces directly
south. Use a compass (or compass app) to ensure accuracy, which has
implications for image processing when creating the panorama. Knock the
dropper into position so the top is ideally 1.3 m above ground level.
The central star dropper should remain a permanent marker to ensure
repeated sampling is taken from the exact location.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow the instructions provided in the applicable protocol to
mark the photopoint location in the Monitor app.</p>

<li><p>Once the star dropper is positioned, measure from the ground up
1.3 m using a tape measure, and wrap a small (~15 cm) length of tape
around the star dropper. The top of the tape line needs to be exactly
1.3 m (see photo).</p></li>

<li><p>From the top of the tape line, using a tape measure, measure up
25 cm, and wrap a small (~15 cm) length of tape around the star
dropper.</p></li>

25 cm, and adjust if necessary.</p>
