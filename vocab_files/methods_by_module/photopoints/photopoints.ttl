<p>Camera</p>
<p>TERN typically use the following camera and lens models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canon EOS 550D DSLR cropped sensor camera, with 18-200 mm zoom lens set at 24 mm focal length. For cropped sensor cameras similar to this, aim for a 50% overlap between photos in the panorama sequence. Completing the full 360o panorama should take around 22 photos.</li>
<li>Canon EOS 6D Mark II full frame DSLR camera, with a Canon EF 24-70 mm zoom lens set at 24 mm focal length. For full frame cameras like this, aim for 50% overlap between photos in the panorama sequence, just like if using a cropped sensor camera, but expect less photos to be required. Completing the full 360o panorama should take around 16 photos.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to familiarise yourself with the camera before the field survey commences, and take the camera manual with you into the field for reference if needed. You will need to know how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>check and change the date and time</li>
<li>change the file format to shoot in RAW+JPEG</li>
<li>change the camera mode to Auto and Aperture priority (Av mode if using a Canon; mode names will vary between makes, use your manual for reference)</li>
<li>change the aperture to F11 (f stop)</li>
<li>adjust the lens focal length to 24 mm</li>
<li>change the lens from auto-focus to manual focus</li>
<li>mount the camera on the tripod, adjust the tripod height, and check that the tripod is evenly balanced (preferably by reading the spirit level if one is fitted on the tripod).</li>
</ul>
<p>Memory cards</p>
<p>Choose a SD or compact flash card (depending on your camera requirements) with a high camera write-speed, such as a SanDisk Extreme Pro or Lexar Professional. The faster the write-speed, the less time wasted waiting for the camera to be ready between taking the photos. USB read-speed (copying the files to the computer) is of less importance. TERN typically uses SanDisk Extreme Pro 128GB SDXC (which have a 170MB/s transfer speed).</p>
<p>Calibration target</p>
<p>TERN has designed and developed a calibration target (see Figure 4 below). Use of the calibration target in the panoramas aids processing the photos, but is not critical. The procedures below include detail on how to use the calibration target, and what to do when the target is not used.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<p>Establishing the photopoints for the first time</p>
<ol>
<li>The centre of the plot should have been established in the Plot positioning and layout module.</li>
<li>Position a central star dropper so that one rib faces directly south, use a compass (or app) to ensure accuracy as this has implications for the image processing when creating the panorama. Knock the dropper into position so that the top is 1.3 m above ground level. Ideally, the central star dropper should remain as a permanent marker to ensure repeated sampling is precisely the same.

<p>Fitting the calibration target (if using one)</p>

<li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="MuseoSans-300, MuseoSans-300_MSFontService, sans-serif" data-listid="35" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">Position the calibration target over the central star dropper. There is no start/end to the target QR code sequence, so there is no need be concerned with how it faces each pointpoint. However, it is important that the calibration target remains in the exact same position for each of the three pointpoints. If it is windy, consider taping the bottom to the star dropper so it does not wobble.

</li>
</ol>
<p>Marking the star dropper when not using a calibration target</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the star dropper is positioned, using a tape measure, measure from the ground up 1.3 m, and wrap a small (~15 cm) length of tape around the star dropper. The bottom of the tape line needs to be exactly 1.3 m (see photo).</li>
<li>From the bottom of the tape line, using a tape measure, measure down 25 cm, and wrap a small (~15 cm) length of tape around the star dropper.</li>
<li>Double check that the distance between the two tapes (excluding the tape iteself) is precisely 25 cm, and adjust if necessary.

<li>Once the first Photopoint QR code is displayed, with the DSLR camera still set to auto, hold the App screen displaying the first photopoint QR code, half pressing the shutter button first to ensure the screen is in focus.</li>
<li>Set the appropriate shutter speed depending on the light conditions. To determine the appropriate shutter speed:</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>set the camera to the aperture priority mode (refer to the your manual)</li>
<li>point the camera in the four major compass directions while half depressing the shot button to get a shutter speed setting in each direction, and roughly calculate the average of these</li>
<li>set the camera on manual mode and select the shutter speed closest to this value</li>
<li>set the lens focus to auto, take a test image in the direction of the sun and view it on the screen to ensure the image is correctly exposed. If overexposed, increase the shutter speed until the image is suitable. If too dark, slow the shutter speed until the image is suitable.</li>
<li>Delete the test image(s). Note: low shutter speeds will mean that the camera must be kept very stable when taking photos to avoid blurring.</li>
</ol>
<li>Keep the lens focus on auto.</li>
<li>Pick a point in the distance and half press the shutter button so it focusses in the distance (the calibration will be blury).</li>
<li>Switch the lens focus from Auto to Manual.</li>
<li>Face with camera directly at the calibration target, ensuring that as much of the target is visible as possible (the top of the target must be included). Take a photo.

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Pre-field collection</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Familiarise yourself with the camera, and refer the cameras manual to change the date and time, change the file format to RAW+JPEG, change the camera mode to aperture priority, set the aperture (f stop), and set the lens focal length.</li>
<li>If conducting the photopoints module at a plot that has already been previously established using procedures and guidelines in Plot layout and positioning module, check that the module was fully completed and that the centre post used for the photopoint was installed. If not, ensure you have a star dropper available for when you visit the plot to take the photos.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Field collection</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>At the start of each survey, check the camera settings to ensure the correct date and time. Date and time may be used to cross-reference photos against the app data.</li>
<li>If the camera has the ability, ensure GPS location settings are enabled (optional setting, and not a requirement).</li>
<li>The photo sequences should be taken between 10 am and 4 pm (where possible) to minimise sun and shadow effects on the photos and to ensure good illumination. It may be appropriate to take photos outside these times if there is reasonable light, and the light is diffused (i.e. consistent cloud cover). Overcast conditions are favourable.</li>
<li>In some communities where the vegetation is dense, or where the landscape prohibits a clear field of view at the plot centre or ability to position the star dropper (i.e. due to a large boulder right the plot centre, the photopoint star dropper may be relocated off-centre. This should be no more than 5 m from the actual centre point, and the location must be updated in the Plot layout and positioning module.</li>
<li>In some communities where dense vegetation prohibits a clear field of view, or where the landscape prohibits the positioning of the star dropper (i.e. due to a large boulder right at the plot centre), the photopoint star dropper may be relocated off-centre. This should be no more than 10 m from the actual centre point, and the location must be updated in the Plot layout and positioning module (ideally this would have been considered when the plot was being established, not as an afterthought once the photopoints were being conducted).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Post-field survey</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Photos must not be edited, cropped, or have watermarks or filters applied.</li>
<li>File names should not be re-named from the default camera name assigned.</li>
<li>Properties/EXIF metadata of the photos should not be edited, i.e. date, time and gps locations (if applicable), should not be altered with, however additional data may be added.</li>
