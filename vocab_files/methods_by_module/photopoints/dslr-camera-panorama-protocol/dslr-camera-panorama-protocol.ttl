protocol</h1>
<h2 id="field-collection">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plot must be established using the Plot Layout and Selection
Module prior to conducting the DSLR panorama protocol. The centre
position must be marked with a star-dropper.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements">Time requirements</h3>
<p>The time to complete the photopoints using the DSLR protocol will
vary depending on the user skill level and experience using the DSLR
camera and the ability to change the various camera and lens settings.
The density of the vegetation will influence the time taken to locate
the centre post. As a general guide, for each plot:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1 hour before the survey to pack the required equipment and
check everything is functional, batteries are charged, and the
appropriate memory/SD cards are clear.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20 minutes to take the equipment to the centre post, mark
out the triangle, set-up the tripod, and attach the camera to the
tripod.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 10 – 30 minutes to take the three panoramas.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 10 – 20 minutes to pack up the tripod, tape measures, and
store equipment safely.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Photopoints are best conducted with two personnel but can be
conducted by just one.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor should be familiar with and experienced in the
operation of the camera, and able to adjust the settings as required. If
surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising,
using instruction manuals, and seeking advice before conducting this
protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking photos does not involve interference with wildlife.
Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are unlikely
to be required but always check with your local authority. Access
permissions are required.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>At the start of each survey, check the camera settings to ensure
the correct date and time. Date and time may be used to cross-reference
photos against the app data.</p></li>
<li><p>If the camera has the ability, ensure GPS location settings are
enabled (optional setting, and not a requirement).</p></li>
<li><p>The photo sequences should be taken between 10 am and 4 pm (where
possible) to minimise sun and shadow effects on the photos and to ensure
good illumination. It may be appropriate to take photos outside these
times if there is reasonable light and the light is diffused (i.e.
consistent cloud cover). Overcast conditions are favourable.</p></li>
<li><p>In some communities where the vegetation is dense or where the
landscape prohibits a clear field of view at the plot centre or the
ability to position the star dropper (i.e. due to a large boulder right
at the plot centre, the photopoint star dropper may be relocated
off-centre. This should be no more than 5 m from the actual centre
point, and the location must be updated in the Plot layout and
positioning module.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that there are no items obstructing the photo (e.g.
fingers).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that you have removed the bag containing the camera or any
other field gear is removed from view.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that there is no flagging tape remaining on the star
dropper.</p></li>

for sloping ground – when the horizon is not horizontal</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking a series of photos to form a panorama is difficult when
the plot is on sloping ground. The following adjustments are recommended
and take note these do take some practice.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Instead of holding the camera straight, firmly locked onto the
tripod for the entire sweep, loosen the knob to allow the camera some
movement (be careful the camera does not fall off). Instead of trying to
follow a would-be flat horizon, adjust the sideways angle of the camera.
Another way is to visualise that you are trying to aim at keeping the
camera looking towards the trees in the background at the height of 1.3
m. Adjust the angle of the camera so that you are looking at the 1.3 m
mark rather than moving higher up the trunk or lower down the
trunk.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="post-field-survey">Post-field survey</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Photos must not be edited, cropped, or have watermarks or filters
applied.</p></li>
<li><p>File names should not be re-named from the default camera name
assigned.</p></li>
<li><p>Properties/EXIF metadata of the photos should not be edited, i.e.
date, time and GPS locations (if applicable), and should not be altered
with, however, additional data may be added.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>The centre of the plot should have been established in the Plot
Positioning and Layout Module. If it was not established, use the module
to complete the layout step. Note that whilst ideal, the centre post
does not have to be precisely at the plot centre. There will be times
when the post will need to be re-positioned to allow for trees, dense
vegetation that would not allow for any useful photos, or rocky terrain
that would not allow for the post to be positioned. The re-positioned
location should not be more than 10 m from the plot centre.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Position a central star dropper so that one rib faces directly
south. Use a compass (or compass app) to ensure accuracy, which has
implications for image processing when creating the panorama. Knock the
dropper into position so the top is ideally 1.3 m above ground level.
The central star dropper should remain a permanent marker to ensure
repeated sampling is taken from the exact location.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow the instructions provided in the applicable protocol to
mark the photopoint location in the Monitor app.</p>

   <h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>The following equipment is required to take the photo panoramas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>DSLR camera with a 15 megapixel or greater sensor and able to
shoot in RAW format, with either a 24 mm fixed lens or zoom lens set at
24 mm focal length</p></li>
<li><p>Operational manual for the camera</p></li>
<li><p>Memory cards (either SD or compact flash depending on the camera
requirements), minimum 8 GB capacity per plot</p></li>
<li><p>Tripod that enables the camera to be set to a height where the
centre of the lens sits at 1.3 m, ideally with a built-in bubble spirit
level to ensure the camera is level</p></li>
<li><p>Coloured tape (or similar) for marking the star dropper (any
colour)</p></li>
<li><p>5 m tape measure</p></li>
<li><p>3 tent pegs (ideally) or 3 clothes pegs</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile device (tablet/phone) with the App installed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For installing or re-positioning the centre post (refer to <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout Module</a>):</p>

<h5 class="unnumbered" id="camera">Camera</h5>
<p>Details of the camera and lens that TERN typically use are provided
below as an example of the equipment the panoramas for photopoints using
the TERN method (see White et al. 2012).:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Canon EOS 550D DSLR cropped sensor camera, with 18-200 mm zoom
lens set at 24 mm focal length. For cropped sensor cameras similar to
this, aim for a 50% overlap between photos in the panorama sequence.
Completing the full 360<sup>o</sup> panorama should take around 22
photos.</p></li>
<li><p>Canon EOS 6D Mark II full frame DSLR camera, with a Canon EF
24-70 mm zoom lens set at 24 mm focal length. For full frame cameras
like this, aim for 50% overlap between photos in the panorama sequence,
just like if using a cropped sensor camera, but expect less photos to be
required. Completing the full 360<sup>o</sup> panorama should take
around 16 photos.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="memory-cards">Memory cards</h5>
<p>Choose a SD or compact flash card (depending on your camera
requirements) with a high camera write-speed, such as a SanDisk Extreme
Pro or Lexar Professional. The faster the write-speed, the less time
wasted waiting for the camera to be ready between taking the photos. USB
read-speed (copying the files to the computer) is of less importance.
TERN typically uses SanDisk Extreme Pro 128GB SDXC (which have a 170MB/s
transfer speed).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
