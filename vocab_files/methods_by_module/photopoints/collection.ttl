  <h1 id="module-overview">Module overview</h1>
<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols</h2>
<p>The Photopoints Module covers the procedures and guidelines of three
protocols for establishing photopoints within the plot. The three
protocols are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1cc740f1-d659-48c7-b9d0-55ae8ddfbed8">DSLR Camera Panorama Protocol</a> – 360<sup>o</sup> panorama taken at
three photopoints located around the plot's centre using a DSLR or
high-end mirrorless camera that allows the user to set specific camera
and lens settings, including focal length, aperture, and ISO.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/b5eee078-d1f8-4ced-9f1a-182dadb0c7a5">Compact Camera Panorama Protocol</a> – 360<sup>o</sup> panorama taken
at three photopoints located around the centre of the plot using a
compact camera without the ability to set all the specific camera and
lens settings required of the DSLR panorama protocol.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/a6d4a219-7bbf-4017-91c6-106b4848480c">Device Camera Panorama Protocol</a> – 360<sup>o</sup> panorama taken
at three photopoints located around the centre of the plot using the
Monitor app on a mobile phone or tablet.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Photopoints Module is conducted at both Core Plots and Fauna
Plots. All three protocols require identifying the plot centre, marking
the plot centre with a star dropper, measuring an equilateral triangle
around the centre post to identify the locations of the three
photopoints (see <a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>), and taking a series of photos
to create a 360<sup>o</sup> panorama. The three protocols only differ in
the camera used, and integration of the Monitor app.</p>
<p>The Photopoints Module enables photopoint photos to be processed to
provide three-dimensional reconstructions of each plot which can be used
to monitor vegetation change over time to track plot condition and
provide an estimation of the basal area at the plot level, which can be
used to estimate biomass. To allow for future three-dimensional
reconstruction and generation of the data, three panoramas are collected
from three precise photopoint positions (based on an equilateral
triangle with sides 2.5 m).</p>

to complete the layout step. Note that whilst ideal, the centre post
does not have to be precisely at the plot centre. There will be times
when the post will need to be re-positioned to allow for trees, dense
vegetation that would not allow for any useful photos, or rocky terrain
that would not allow for the post to be positioned. The re-positioned
location should not be more than 10 m from the plot centre.</p></li>

south. Use a compass (or compass app) to ensure accuracy, which has
implications for image processing when creating the panorama. Knock the

The central star dropper should remain a permanent marker to ensure
repeated sampling is taken from the exact location.</p></li>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Ground-based photos are a key component of environmental surveys as
they provide a visual reference of a plot at the time of the survey
(Pickard 2002), and repeat plot photos provide important qualitative
data for long-term ecological monitoring (Michel <em>et al.</em> 2010).
In addition, plot photos allow stakeholders (or others that were not
involved in the on-ground survey) to visually perceive the plot and
better understand descriptions and data relating to the landform
position and structure of the vegetation.</p>
<p>The major advantages of photogrammetry using ground-based
photo-panoramas include the low cost, portability and ease of operation
(for non-specialist field surveyors) of the equipment. In contrast,
Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) instruments used to collect lidar
(light detection and ranging) data, which have been used successfully to
highly accurately characterise vegetation structure attributes, require
a significant upfront cost and have reduced portability.</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
    tern:scope """
     <h1 id="introduction">Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>The Photopoints Module outlines the steps to take a series of photos
of the plot to collect monitoring data. When the photos are taken
following the protocols outlined in this module, the photos provide a
high-resolution visual reference of the plot at the time of the survey
and enable a three-dimensional reconstruction of the plot. This
transforms the ‘static’ photos into actual monitoring data able to be
interrogated for changes in the plot over time and assessed against
management outcomes.</p>
<p>Photopoint monitoring is typically used to record and monitor
environmental change over time and involves taking periodic photos from
fixed, permanently marked locations (Pickard 2002; O’Connor and Bond
2007). Photopoint monitoring is quick, inexpensive, and does not require
specialised skills or training (Hall 2002). However, photos are
typically taken and kept as records for visual reference only, enabling
before, during and after transformation visualisations that can support
field-collected measures, but the downfall is that they do not generate
actual data.</p>
<p>Photo panoramas (a single panorama or a series of photos stitched
together to form a single wide-angle photo up to 360<sup>o</sup>) are
increasingly being collected during photopoint monitoring (Department of
Planning Industry and Environment 2020; Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020)
and can be used to capture an entire landscape or monitoring plot, while
maintaining image detail (Nichols <em>et al.</em> 2009). Image
processing software is used to stitch overlapping images together to
depict a field of view considerably wider (up to 360°) than one that can
be captured in a single exposure (Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020). Even
low-cost, amateur digital cameras and mobile phone cameras can produce
auto or semiauto photo-panoramas (Nichols <em>et al.</em> 2009). In
addition, photogrammetry, which allows a three-dimensional model to be
constructed from two-dimensional images (Muir 2018), can be undertaken
using ground-based photo panoramas, and this can be used for
measurements of vegetation structure attributes (Liang <em>et al.</em>
2014; Morgenroth and Gómez 2014; Muir 2018).</p>
<p>In the review of 30 Regional Land Partnerships projects that were
investigated to identify the types of ecological monitoring methods
employed, just four projects were taking representative photos of the
vegetation units within the project area, five projects took
representative photos of monitoring plots, and 10 were taking photos of
the monitoring points across the project area that were not necessarily
related to areas where direct measures were taken (TERN 2020).</p>
<p>The Photopoints Module involves the collection of high-resolution
photos from the plot to enable three-dimensional point-cloud
reconstruction of the plot (see <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a> for an example) and enable
algorithms to be applied to create data on biomass, carbon, and basal
area of the plot, relatively cheaply, yet relatively scientifically
accurate. The photopoints should be established as soon as possible once
a project commences (if not earlier) to gain baseline photos and data.
The intervals of repeating the photopoints depend on the goals of the
project and the logistics of re-visiting the plot. Photos are
recommended to be taken at least every 12 months (i.e. at approximately
the same month each year). Shorter periods, e.g. 3 – 6 months, are
helpful in identifying seasonal changes. Implementing the Photopoints
Module in either of the three protocols specified future proofs the
project and dataset, enabling the application of future post-processing
analysis techniques to generate data we are currently not aware of.</p>
