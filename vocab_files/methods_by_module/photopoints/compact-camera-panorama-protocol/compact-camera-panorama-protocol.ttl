Protocol</h1>
<h2 id="field-collection-2">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites-1">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plot must be established using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout Module</a> prior to conducting the Compact camera panorama protocol. The
centre position must be marked with a star-dropper.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-1">Time requirements</h3>
<p>The time to complete the photopoints using the Compact protocol will
vary depending on the user's skill level and experience using the
camera. The density of the vegetation will influence the time taken to
locate the centre post. As a general guide, for each plot:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1 hour before the survey to pack the required equipment and
check everything is functional, batteries are charged and the
appropriate memory/SD cards are clear.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20 minutes to take the equipment to the centre post, mark
out the triangle, and set-up the tripod, and attach the camera to the
tripod.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 10 minutes to take the three panoramas.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 10 – 20 minutes to pack up the tripod, tape measures, and
store equipment safely.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-1">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Photopoints is best conducted with two personnel but can be
conducted by just one.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor should be familiar with and experienced in the
operation of the camera. If surveyors are not confident, time should be
dedicated to practising, using instruction manuals, and seeking advice
before conducting this protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking photos does not involve interference with wildlife.
Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are unlikely
to be required but always check with your local authority. Access
permissions are required.</p></li>

<li><p>If the camera has the ability, ensure GPS location settings are
enabled (optional setting, and not a requirement).</p></li>
<li><p>The photo sequences should be taken between 10 am and 4 pm (where
possible) to minimise sun and shadow effects on the photos and to ensure
good illumination. It may be appropriate to take photos outside these
times if there is reasonable light, and the light is diffused (i.e.
consistent cloud cover). Overcast conditions are favourable.</p></li>
<li><p>In some communities where the vegetation is very dense, it may
not be possible to obtain useful panoramas as the vegetation is in close
proximity to the camera giving little or no depth to the photo. Still
take the panoramas, but also take other photos of the plot, including
representative photos in cardinal compass directions (in the sequence of
due north, east, south, west) of the community as a reference for the
plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Photopoint centre post locations can be adjusted to suit the
vegetation and terrain. See <a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a> for instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid taking photos with people in the background.</p></li>

for sloping ground – when the horizon is not horizontal</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking a series of photos to form a panorama is difficult when
the plot is on sloping ground. The following adjustments are recommended
and take note these do take some practice.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Instead of holding the camera straight, firmly locked onto the
tripod for the entire sweep, loosen the knob to allow the camera some
movement (be careful the camera does not fall off). Instead of trying to
follow a would-be flat horizon, adjust the sideways angle of the camera.
Another way is to visualise that you are trying to aim at keeping the
camera looking towards the trees in the background at the height of 1.3
m. Adjust the angle of the camera so that you are looking at the 1.3 m
mark, rather than moving higher up the trunk or lower down the
trunk.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>The centre of the plot should have been established in the Plot
Positioning and Layout Module. If it was not established, use the module
to complete the layout step. Note that whilst ideal, the centre post
does not have to be precisely at the plot centre. There will be times
when the post will need to be re-positioned to allow for trees, dense
vegetation that would not allow for any useful photos, or rocky terrain
that would not allow for the post to be positioned. The re-positioned
location should not be more than 10 m from the plot centre.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Position a central star dropper so that one rib faces directly
south. Use a compass (or compass app) to ensure accuracy, which has
implications for image processing when creating the panorama. Knock the
dropper into position so the top is ideally 1.3 m above ground level.
The central star dropper should remain a permanent marker to ensure
repeated sampling is taken from the exact location.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow the instructions provided in the applicable protocol to
mark the photopoint location in the Monitor app.</p>

<li><p>Before commencing the Compact camera panorama protocol,
familiarise yourself with your camera before the field survey commences,
and take the camera manual into the field with you for reference if
needed. The procedures below provide information on the recommended
settings to which you should set your camera to if it allows. These are
listed below.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>If adjustable, set the focal length to the widest setting
(ideally 24 mm as per the DSLR protocol).</p></li>
<li><p>If adjustable, set the ISO to 100 (if not adjustable, leave in
full auto setting).</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If adjustable, set the camera to take RAW image file types, (or
RAW+JPEG) format (not just JPEG). Use JPEG only if RAW is not an
option.</p></li>
<li><p>If available, turn on grid lines (to help keep the camera
horizontal (on flat ground at least) when a tripod is not being
used.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the date and time are correct.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the photo quality to the highest available.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Ensure the camera memory card has at least 4 GB spare
capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do not have a tripod/tripod mount on the camera, determine
where on your body 1.3 m from the ground is – this is the height you
will aim to hold the mobile device camera lens at whilst taking the
panoramas.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if the plot has been established in the past using the
