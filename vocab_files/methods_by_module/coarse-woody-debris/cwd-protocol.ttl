<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols </h2>
<p>The Coarse Woody Debris Module (CWD) covers the procedures and
guidelines to record CWD length, diameter and decay class at a core
monitoring plot. The module allows either a 10 cm or 5 cm diameter
threshold and 30 cm or 50 cm length threshold depending on the system
and provides instructions for how to analyse CWD length and volume.
Additionally, there is the option to record tree stump height, diameter
and decay class within the Coarse Woody Debris protocol.</p>

<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plot must be established using the Plot Layout and Selection
Module prior to conducting the Coarse Woody Debris Module.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey activity time estimates will vary depending on the plot size
chosen, the structural formation of the system (woodland, forest,
grassland, etc.) and the abundance and density of coarse woody debris
and tree stumps within the plot.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1–2 hours for survey planning.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20–40 minutes for plot set-up and laying tape-measures
(assuming the plot has been previously set-up using the Plot Selection
and Layout Module).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 1–4 hours to complete and record all CWD (and optionally
tree stump) measurements in a 100 x 100 m core monitoring plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 0.5–3 hours to complete and record all CWD (and optionally
tree stump) measurements in a 40 x 40 m sub-plot.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements">Personnel requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Completion of the Coarse Woody Debris Module is preferable with
two personnel. This enables one person to measure each piece of CWD or
tree stump while the other simultaneously records the measurements into
the Monitor app. The second person may also assist with taking
measurements and in determination of decay class.</p></li>
<li><p>Personnel must be familiar with the use of a diameter tape and/or
a 5–10 m tape measure.</p></li>
<li><p>The Coarse Woody Debris Module does not involve interference with
vegetation or wildlife. Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife
ethics approvals are unlikely to be required but always check with your
local authority. Access permissions will likely be required.</p></li>

<li><p>If the average diameter at breast height (DBH) of trees in the
study system is between 5–15 cm then use 5 cm cut-off for CWD.
Generally, this will only occur in some mallee and mulga communities, or
as a consequence of intervention in an area (e.g. clear-felling or
regeneration planting project). Measurements from the Recruitment or
Basal Area Modules can be used to inform the use of the 5 cm
cut-off.</p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended that the CWD and tree stump measurements are
done immediately after the Cover Module point-intercept survey to take
advantage of the transect lines already laid. These transects can be
used to divide the plot into smaller areas and assist with the

<h1 id="data-submission">Data submission </h1>
<p>Data from the Plot Description Module is collected in the field using
the Monitor app. All data is checked for correctness and completeness in
the app before it is submitted.</p>
<p>Once all data is finalised, and marked as complete, the data is
submitted from the Monitor app to the staging server by an explicit user
action. If the device is offline at the time, the data will be pushed as
soon as it is reconnected to a network (i.e. either back in mobile phone
range or a wi-fi network). Once data reaches the staging server it is
prepared in an export interface for delivery to the Biodiversity Data
Repository. DCCEEW is then responsible for managing the data. In the
future, it is anticipated that data curation tools will be made
available to project personnel.</p>
<h1 id="data-use-and-reason-for-collection">Data use and reason for
collection</h1>
<h2 id="data-use-to-date">Data use to date</h2>
<p>Coarse woody debris data is a measure commonly collected as part of
habitat condition assessments. It can be used for a range of purposes
including as an indicator of habitat complexity and value, disturbance
and condition.</p>
<p>CWD and tree stumps play an important role in ecosystem processes.
CWD can be an important measure for land management decisions (Miehs
<em>et al.</em> 2010) and can indicate where CWD may need to be added to
systems as part of restoration works (Manning <em>et al.</em> 2013).
Disturbance history and condition can be evaluated based on the amount
of CWD and tree stumps present in a system as dieback through disease,
insect attack, environmental change and competition can lead to tree
stump development and add CWD to the landscape (Woldendorp <em>et
al.</em> 2002a).</p>
<p>Along with understorey vegetation, CWD is the most important habitat
for small animals and arthropods (Jia-bing <em>et al.</em> 2005).
Consequently, an understanding of the amount of CWD in a system can be
used to assess relationships between fauna and habitat features and can
be used as an indicator of habitat complexity and value (Mac Nally
<em>et al.</em> 2001; Manning <em>et al.</em> 2013). Measuring CWD can
also indicate how different management practices influence fauna habitat
availability (Threlfall <em>et al.</em> 2021). CWD also has a close
relationship with the diversity of many plants and fungi (Jia-bing
<em>et al.</em> 2005), and is an important measure for condition
assessments (Michaels 2006; Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009; Eyre <em>et
al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>CWD and tree stumps are important components in the forest carbon
cycle, as they are a store and source of carbon (Woldendorp <em>et
al.</em> 2002a). Volume calculations are the basis for estimating
biomass and carbon (Waddell 2002). Decay classes can help identify the
range of decomposition states present and are important for accurate
biomass estimations (Waddell 2002; Didion and Abegg 2022) and to get an
understanding of the biological processes occurring (Meggs 1996). In
addition, CWD and tree stumps can contribute to fuel loads and influence
fire behaviour, so can be important for factor for fire management and
planning (Woodall <em>et al.</em> 2009; Aponte <em>et al.</em> 2014;
Bassett <em>et al.</em> 2015; Didion and Abegg 2022).</p>
<h2 id="future-use-of-the-data">Future use of the data</h2>
<p>Knowledge of the size class distribution, quantity, condition, and
spatial arrangement of CWD is required to inform management activities
that can alter CWD abundances (Whitford and McCaw 2019). Mean per
hectare values are a common way to present CWD estimates because they
allow for easy comparison among different ecosystem types, habitats and
locations, as well as over time (Waddell 2002). CWD data can be compared
spatially and temporally to evaluate CWD loads across the landscape, to
compare CWD abundance with different land management practices and
assess changes in CWD loads over time following interventions or a
change in land management practices. Similarly, tree stump abundance can
be used as an indicator of anthropogenic or natural disturbance, or as
part of condition assessments. Tree stump volume per hectare can be
compared across systems and sites, and over time, and for use in biomass
and carbon calculations and fire behaviour modelling (Woodall <em>et
al.</em> 2009).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale </h2>
<p>Coarse woody debris contributes to a range of ecosystem processes,
including nutrient cycling and storage, soil formation, stability, and
retention, retaining moisture and enhancing water infiltration,
improving thermal conditions, and providing sites for litter
accumulation (Grove and Meggs 2003; Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2004;
Manning <em>et al.</em> 2013; Goldin 2020). CWD and tree stumps can also
influence fuel loads and fire dynamics (Miehs et al. 2010), and can be a
preferred habitat feature for a range of fauna, including shelter,
nesting and denning sites for a variety of mammals, reptiles and some
birds (Mac Nally et al. 2001; Threlfall et al. 2021). Decaying wood
provides substrate and nutrients for invertebrates and fungi. Both CWD
and tree stumps are important for forest regeneration by providing
favourable substrate for seedling establishment, while stumps are also
capable of reshooting (Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2002b; Grove and Meggs
2003; Motta <em>et al.</em> 2006; Bace <em>et al.</em> 2011). Despite
its importance in a range of systems, CWD is often difficult to study
because of its patchy distribution, and this can be especially
problematic in woodland ecosystems, where CWD is relatively scarce,
unevenly distributed and smaller in size than other forest types (Miehs
<em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>
<p>A range of different methods have been used to capture information on
CWD, including various transect, strip plot and quadrat designs (e.g.
Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2002a; Kanowski <em>et al.</em> 2003;
Michaels 2006; Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010; Whitford <em>et al.</em>
2011; Aponte <em>et al.</em> 2014; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015; Threlfall
<em>et al.</em> 2021). Plots are the predominant technique used
(Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2000; Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010). However, no
consistent sampling method has been adopted to date, largely due to the
structural differences between woody systems (Woldendorp <em>et al.</em>
2004; Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010). Similarly, there is very little
published in relation to sampling tree stumps as they are often excluded
from CWD and tree surveys as they do not fit within the definitions and
scope of either component. Therefore, a plot-based approach has been
adopted for this module to align with existing condition methods used in
Australia (Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015), to allow a condition sub-plot to
be comprehensively surveyed for a range of attributes, and because a
sub-plot is generally more effective for surveying tree stumps and when
CWD is in low abundances (Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2002b; Bate <em>et
al.</em> 2004; Didion and Abegg 2022). In addition, sampling using a
plot overcomes non-random orientation of CWD due to wind throw,
flooding, topography and harvesting practices, which can influence the
estimates of CWD abundance, depending on transect orientation and layout
(Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2004).</p>
<p>The length and diameter (at both ends) are measured for every piece
of CWD encountered that meet the size thresholds. Thresholds used within
this module align with thresholds used in the scientific literature. For
CWD tapering to less than 10 cm diameter (or 5 cm in applicable
systems), measurements are made only up to the point where the log
tapers to less than the cut-off diameter (Baker and Chao 2011). Taking a
measurement at either end (rather than a mid-point) can substantially
reduce or eliminate bias and produce more accurate volume estimates
(Bate <em>et al.</em> 2009). Allocating a decay class based on the
structural integrity of the wood assists with biomass estimation and
provides an indication of the ecosystem processes occurring (Woldendorp
<em>et al.</em> 2002a; Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2004). The spatial
distribution of CWD is rarely assessed during CWD surveys (Miehs <em>et
al.</em> 2010). However, the distribution of CWD can influence abundance
and volume estimates. Hence, as part of this module, location of CWD
within the plot is recorded. The option to measure tree stump height,
diameter and decay is also included to assist with volume estimates for
biomass and carbon assessments (Didion and Abegg 2022).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;

 <h1 id="introduction">Introduction and Background </h1>
<p>Dead wood forms a significant structural and habitat component of
many ecosystems and is linked to a range of biodiversity and ecosystem
processes (Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2000; Woldendorp and Keenan 2005;
Woodall <em>et al.</em> 2009; Didion and Abegg 2022). Dead wood consists
of fine to coarse woody debris, standing dead trees, downed trees and
tree stumps in various phases of decay (Woodall <em>et al.</em> 2009;
Didion and Abegg 2022). The Coarse Woody Debris Module provides
procedures and guidelines for recording coarse woody debris (CWD)
abundance, dimension and level of decay, to estimate the length and
volume of CWD present in wooded systems. Additionally, procedures are
included for measuring the dimensions and level of decay of tree stumps.
Note that dead standing, and partially downed trees are not assessed in
this module but rather as part of the tree survey in the Condition
Module.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this module, CWD is defined as any fallen trees or
branches with a diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm (Baker and Chao
2011; Goldin 2020), but in some systems, such as woodlands and mallee
woodlands where trunk diameters are smaller, a diameter of greater than
or equal to 5 cm can be used (Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010). Stumps are
defined as standing dead trees where the bulk of the trunk has been
removed by anthropogenic or natural processes (Woodall <em>et al.</em>
2009; Puletti <em>et al.</em> 2019; Didion and Abegg 2022).</p>
<p>Accurate estimation of dead wood, and in particular CWD, is critical
for the effective management of forest and woodland systems (Bate <em>et
al.</em> 2004). Sampling CWD can provide an estimate of the abundance,
cover, volume, length and level of decay of fallen woody material in an
ecosystem (Bate <em>et al.</em> 2009). CWD can take decades to centuries
to accumulate, especially larger pieces, and is influenced by tree
species and age, stand structure, productivity, disturbance, physical
environment and wood decay rate (Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2002a;
Manning <em>et al.</em> 2013). CWD is typical of natural woodland or
forest communities, but it has declined or been lost from many
ecosystems around the world as a result of vegetation clearing, logging,
fire regime and grazing, which reduce the structural diversity of stands
(Manning <em>et al.</em> 2013). CWD abundance is assessed for a range of
purposes, including stand structural assessments, as an indicator of
habitat value for ground-dwelling fauna, carbon biomass estimates, fuel
load estimates, condition assessments and as an indicator of management
or disturbance intensity (Grove 2001; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>As tree stumps also provide habitat, add to structural complexity and
fuel loads, and can indicate disturbance, their inclusion in assessments
is thus valuable for delivering more precise evaluations of carbon,
fire, biodiversity and management and disturbance levels (Woodall <em>et
al.</em> 2009).</p>
<p>Physical and biological processes begin to degrade fallen woody
material through fragmentation and decomposition (Woldendorp <em>et
al.</em> 2002a), so CWD and stumps are often assigned a decay class,
ranging from recently fallen to largely disintegrated (Wundke <em>et
al.</em> 2015; Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2016). The level of decay can
give an indication of return of nutrients to the soil, as it contributes
to the process of soil development, and a range of decay classes can
provide habitat for fungi, plants and invertebrates (Meggs 1996).
Evaluations of decay are also important for procuring accurate biomass
and carbon estimates (Fraver <em>et al.</em> 2013; Didion and Abegg
2022).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
