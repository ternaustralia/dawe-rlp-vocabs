<p>The Coarse Woody Debris Module (CWD) covers the procedures and
guidelines to record CWD length, diameter and decay class at a core
monitoring plot. The module allows either a 10 cm or 5 cm diameter
threshold and 30 cm or 50 cm length threshold depending on the system,
and provides instructions for how to analyse CWD length and volume.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the average diameter at breast height (DBH) of trees in the
study system is between 5-15 cm (can use measurements from the
Recruitment or Basal Area Modules) then use 5 cm cut-off for CWD.
Generally, this will only occur in some mallee and mulga communities or
as a consequence of intervention in an area (e.g. clear-felling or
regeneration planting project).</p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended that the CWD measurements are done
concurrently, or immediately after the Cover Module point-intercept
survey to take advantage of the transect lines already laid. These
transects can be used to divide the plot into smaller areas and assist
with the systematic survey of the area.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not measure any part of the CWD that falls outside of the plot
(<a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>.).</p></li>
<li><p>Measure CWD diameter over bark.</p></li>
<li><p>Length is only measured for the portion of the CWD that meets the
size threshold.</p></li>
<li><p>Four 100 m tape measures are recommended for defining the plot
boundary. Additional tapes can be used to divide the plot into smaller
units to assist with the systematic survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Tape measures with metrics on both sides are
recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Observer should stand at the centre point of CWD when recording
location with the app.</p></li>
<li><p>When measuring a piece of CWD where the roots are attached, do
not record the largest diameter at the roots (<mark></mark><a href="appendices">Appendix
1</a>.).</p></li>
<li><p>CWD is only measured when it is in contact with the ground. CWD
is not measured when suspended in the air with the support of other
trees because pieces suspended off the ground are considered partially
downed trees (<a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a>).</p></li>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale </h2>
<p>Coarse woody debris contributes to a range of ecosystem processes,
including nutrient cycling and storage, soil formation, stability, and
retention, retaining moisture and enhancing water infiltration,
improving thermal conditions, and providing sites for litter
accumulation (Grove and Meggs 2003; Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2004;
Manning <em>et al.</em> 2013; Goldin 2020). Coarse woody debris can also
influence fuel loads and fire dynamics (Miehs et al. 2010), and is a
preferred habitat feature for a range of fauna, including shelter,
nesting and denning sites for a variety of mammals, reptiles and some
birds (Mac Nally et al. 2001; Threlfall et al. 2021). Decaying CWD
provides substrate and nutrients for invertebrates and fungi in addition
to creating sites for seedling establishment (Woldendorp <em>et al.</em>
2002b; Grove and Meggs 2003). Despite its importance in a range of
systems, CWD is often difficult to study because of its patchy
distribution, and this can be especially problematic in woodland
ecosystems, where CWD is relatively scarce, unevenly distributed and
smaller in size than other forest types (Miehs <em>et al.</em>
2010).</p>
<p>A range of different methods have been used to capture information on
CWD, including various transect, strip plot and quadrat designs (e.g.
Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2002a; Kanowski <em>et al.</em> 2003;
Michaels 2006; Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010; Whitford <em>et al.</em>
2011; Aponte <em>et al.</em> 2014; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015; Threlfall
<em>et al.</em> 2021). Plots are the predominant technique used
(Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2000; Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010), however, no
consistent sampling method has been adopted to date, largely due to the
structural differences between woody systems (Woldendorp <em>et al.</em>
2004; Miehs <em>et al.</em> 2010). A plot based approach has been
adopted for this module to align with existing condition methods used in
Australia (Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015), to allow a condition sub-plot to
be comprehensively surveyed for a range of attributes, and because a
sub-plot is generally more effective when CWD is in low abundances
(Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2002b; Bate <em>et al.</em> 2004). In
addition, sampling using a plot overcomes non-random orientation of CWD
due to wind throw, flooding, topography and harvesting practices, which
can influence the estimates of CWD abundance, depending on transect
orientation and layout (Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2004).</p>
<p>The length and diameter (at both ends) are measured for every piece
of CWD encountered that meet the size thresholds. Thresholds used within
this module align with thresholds used in the scientific literature. For
CWD tapering to less than 10 cm diameter (or 5 cm in applicable
systems), measurements are made only up to the point where the log
tapers to less than the cut-off diameter (Baker and Chao 2011). Taking a
measurement at either end (rather than a mid-point) can substantially
reduce or eliminate bias and produce more accurate volume estimates
(Bate <em>et al.</em> 2009). Allocating a decay class based on the
structural integrity of the wood assists with biomass estimation and
provides an indication of the ecosystem processes occurring (Woldendorp
<em>et al.</em> 2002a; Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2004). The spatial
distribution of CWD is rarely assessed during CWD surveys (Miehs <em>et
al.</em> 2010). However, the distribution of CWD can influence abundance
and volume estimates. Hence, as part of this module, location of CWD
within the plot is recorded.</p>

   <h1 id="introduction">Introduction and background </h1>
<p>Coarse woody debris (CWD) is fallen dead wood that forms an important
structural and habitat component of many ecosystems, and is linked to a
range of biodiversity and ecosystem processes (Marshall <em>et al.</em>
2000; Woldendorp and Keenan 2005). The Coarse Woody Debris Module
provides procedures and guidelines for recording CWD abundance,
dimension and level of decay, to estimate the length and volume of CWD
present in wooded systems. For the purpose of this module, CWD is
defined as any fallen trees or branches with a diameter greater than or
equal to 10 cm (Baker and Chao 2011; Goldin 2020), but in some systems,
such as woodlands and mallee woodlands where trunk diameters are
smaller, a diameter of greater than or equal to 5 cm can be used (Miehs
<em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>
<p>Accurate estimation of CWD is critical for the effective management
of forest and woodland systems (Bate <em>et al.</em> 2004). Sampling CWD
can provide an estimate of the abundance, cover, volume, length and
level of decay of fallen woody material in an ecosystem (Bate <em>et
al.</em> 2009). Coarse woody debris can take decades to centuries to
accumulate, especially larger pieces, and is influenced by tree species
and age, stand structure, productivity, disturbance, physical
environment and wood decay rate (Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2002a;
Manning <em>et al.</em> 2013). CWD is typical of natural woodland or
forest communities, but it has declined or been lost from many
ecosystems around the world as a result of vegetation clearing, logging,
fire regime and grazing, which reduce the structural diversity of stands
(Manning <em>et al.</em> 2013). CWD abundance is assessed for a range of
purposes, including stand structural assessments, as an indicator of
habitat value for ground-dwelling fauna, carbon biomass estimates, fuel
load estimates, condition assessments and as an indicator of management
or disturbance intensity (Grove 2001; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>Physical and biological processes begin to degrade fallen woody
material through fragmentation and decomposition (Woldendorp <em>et
al.</em> 2002a), so CWD is often assigned a decay class, ranging from
recently fallen to largely disintegrated (Wundke <em>et al.</em> 2015;
Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2016). The level of decay can give an indication
of return of nutrients to the soil, as it contributes to the process of
soil development, and a range of decay classes can provide habitat for
fungi, plants and invertebrates (Meggs 1996).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
