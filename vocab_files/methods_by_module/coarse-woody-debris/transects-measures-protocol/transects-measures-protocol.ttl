  <li>
    Ensure the Plot selection and layout module has been completed to mark out
    the plot boundary and grid with very high accuracy using the Trimble R1.
  </li>
  <li>Select the Transects option from the Coarse Woody Debris main screen.</li>
  <li>
    Depending on the abundance and distribution of CWD select the 6 or 4
    transects option. The 6 transects option is the default selection. For more
    information about the two variations and selecting the option appropriate
    for the system under study, click on the info buttons within the app.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the CWD diameter cut-off based on the steps in Figures below. As a
    default, this value will be set to 10 cm.

  </li>
  <li>
    For each transect lay out a 100 m tape between the start and end
    points/pegs. Ensure the tape is orientated to align with the grid, is
    straight, and on the ground (where possible) and not draped over shrubs.
    <ul>
      <li>
        If 6 transects are selected, tapes need to be laid at 30, 50 and 70 m in
        a N-S and E-W direction (N/S2, N/S3, N/S4, E/W2, E/W3, E/W4).
      </li>
      <li>
        If 4 transects are selected, tapes need to be laid at 30 and 70 m in a
        N-S and E-W direction (N/S2, N/S4, E/W2, E/W4).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Walk each transect to systematically search for any CWD that intersects the
    tape.
  </li>
  <li>
    Measure any CWD that intersects the transect if it is ≥10 cm diameter at any
    point along its length (or ≥5 cm for eligible systems).
  </li>
  <p>For each eligible piece of CWD:</p>
  <li>
    Record the location of the CWD by standing at the center point of the piece
    and selecting Record Location (ensure the R1 is connected and has high
    accuracy).
  </li>
  <li>
    Record the point of intersection with the transect line, to the closest
    meter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Measure and record the diameter at the widest point of the CWD. This can be
    done using a diameter tape or calipers if the CWD is on the ground and it is
    not possible to wrap a tape measure around the circumference.
  </li>
  <li>
    Measure and record the diameter at the narrowest point, down to a minimum
    diameter of 10 cm (or 5 cm for eligible systems).
  </li>
  <li>
    Measure and record the length of the CWD for the portion of it that is
    greater than 10 cm in diameter (or 5 cm in eligible systems). See the
    supporting information for more details.

  <p>
    Where a piece of CWD is irregular in shape, it should be divided into
    multiple smaller roughly linear and cylindrical sections for ease of
    measurement – see Figure 1 and the supporting information. Each section will
    be recorded as a separate piece of CWD in the app.
  </p>
  <li>Record a decomposition class from Table .</li>
  <li>
    Repeat steps 8-13 for each piece of CWD with a diameter greater than 10 cm
    (or 5 cm) that intercepts any of the transect lines.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select complete transect to save data and move onto the next transect.
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It is recommended that the CWD measurements are done concurrently, or
    immediately after the Cover module to take advantage of the point-intercept
    transects already laid. The CWD transects are a sub-set of those set up for
    the cover point-intercept.
  </li>
  <li>
    The plot should be traversed and CWD abundance assessed before the survey
    design is selected. This can be undertaken while traversing the plot during
    the Floristics and Cover modules.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is recommended that users take note of the amount of CWD that intersects
    the point-intercept transects when undertaking the Cover module, to help
    inform the survey design and increase efficiency in the field.
  </li>
  <li>
    The results from the point-intercept can also give an indication of the most
    suitable CWD design to use (i.e., number of hits along a transect can
    indicate if 4 or 6 transects are suitable or if a plot- based method is
    required). Results from the point-intercept survey should be used in
    combination with knowledge of the site to determine the most appropriate
    method, as not all CWD intersects will be recorded during the
    point-intercept survey.
  </li>
  <li>
    CWD can be patchily distributed, so assess multiple transects before
    deciding about the appropriate number of transects to use. On average, 6-10
    pieces should be intersected per 100 m transect for the 6 transect option
    and ≥11 pieces per 100 m transect for the 4 transect option.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the 4 transect option is selected but not enough pieces of CWD are
    intersected using this method, a warning message will appear. In this case,
    it is possible to add additional transects, to allow data to be collected
    from the NS and EW 50 m transects as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    If decay status varies along the piece of CWD, record the most dominant
    decay class, and not the class at the point of intersection.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a piece of CWD intersects multiple transects, it should only be measured
    once.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a piece of CWD intersects more than one transects, or for areas with high
    abundance of CWD or clustered CWD, mark (survey pin, flagging tape, paint)
    CWD that has been measured to avoid duplicate measures.
  </li>
  <li>
    Measure CWD diameter at the widest and narrowest end and not the diameter
    that intersects the tape.
  </li>
  <li>CWD diameter is recorded in cm and length is recorded in m.</li>
  <li>Measure CWD diameter over bark.</li>
  <li>
    Length is only measured for the portion of the CWD that meets the size
    threshold and is within the plot.
  </li>
  <li>
    A cased tape measure is recommended for recording CWD lengths, as they are
    compact and easily retractable.
  </li>
