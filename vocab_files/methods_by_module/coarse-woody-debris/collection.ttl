  This module covers the procedures and guidelines of two main protocols for
  recording CWD within the plot. Each protocol has two options, depending on CWD
  abundance.

<p>Transects</p>

  CWD abundance and sampling design

<p>The Coarse Woody Debris module is linked to the following modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Condition – CWD must be collected as part of the condition module. Finer
    woody debris and litter cover are collected as part of the condition
    point-intercept.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cover – The CWD transect sampling methods use a subset of the
    point-intercept transects set up for the Cover module. It is recommended
    that CWD survey be undertaken after the Cover module. CWD hits are recorded
    as part of the point-intercept survey and percent cover of CWD can be
    calculated using these results.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Survey type selection</strong></p>
<p>
  Option 1a with 6 transects is the preferred method, but variations are
  provided on this design, depending on the abundance and distribution of CWD
  within the plot. If CWD is abundant at the site and collecting from all 6
  transects will be time consuming (&gt;60 CWD pieces sampled) and add little
  extra information, CWD data can be collected across 4 transects, if on
  average, 11 or more pieces of CWD are intersected per 100 m transect.
</p>
<p>
  If CWD is in low abundance, then plot based sampling should be used. A 50 x 50
  m plot is the preferred option in this case and should be used if at least
  36-40 pieces of CWD occur within the 50 x 50 m area. If
</p>
<p>
  ≤ 40 pieces of CWD are present across the entire 1 ha plot, then the 100 x 100
  m area should be selected.
</p>

<p><strong>Instructions and procedures</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Determine if the 10 cm diameter threshold is appropriate for the system
    under study, by undertaking a quick assessment of tree size (trunk diameter)
    and CWD size (this will generally only be required in some woodland and
    mallee woodland systems. As a standard, 10 cm should be used for forests).
    See figures below for more information about selecting the most appropriate
    diameter cut-off.
  </li>
  <li>
    Undertake a quick assessment of the site to get an understanding of the
    amount of CWD present (this can be undertaken at the same time as the point
    intercept transects).
  </li>
  <li>
    The number of CWD hits from the point-intercept can also give an indication
    to the most appropriate design.
  </li>
  <li>
    Work through the decision framework above to determine the most appropriate
    survey option for the system under study.
  </li>
  <li>
    Based on the results from Step 4, proceed to either Option 1 (Transects) or
    Option 2 (Plots) to commence the field survey.
  </li>
