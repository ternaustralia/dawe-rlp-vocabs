<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It is recommended that the CWD measurements are done concurrently, or
    immediately after the Cover point-intercept to take advantage of the
    transect lines already laid. These transects can be used to divide the plot
    into smaller areas and assist with the systematic survey of the area.
  </li>
  <li>
    The plot should be traversed and CWD abundance assessed before the survey
    design is selected. This can be undertaken while traversing the plot during
    the Floristics and Cover modules.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is recommended that users take note of the amount of CWD that intersects
    the point-intercept transects when undertaking the Cover module, to help
    inform the survey design and increase efficiency in the field.
  </li>
  <li>
    The results from the point intercept can give an indication of the most
    suitable CWD design to use, but it is likely that not all pieces of CWD that
    intersect the transect will be recorded during the point-intercept survey,
    so should be used in combination with a quick site assessment.
  </li>
  <li>
    CWD can be patchily distributed, so assess multiple transects before
    deciding about the use of transects of plot sampling. If ≤ 5 pieces of CWD
    on average intersect a 100 m transect, then plots should be used.
  </li>
  <li>
    For areas with high abundance of CWD or clustered CWD, mark (survey pin,
    flagging tape, paint) CWD that has been measured to avoid duplicate
    measures.
  </li>
  <li>
    If decay status varies along the piece of CWD, record the most dominant
    decay class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Measure CWD diameter at the widest and narrowest end that are within the
    plot. Do not measure any part of the CWD that falls outside of the plot.
  </li>
  <li>
    Measurements of length are made to the plot border, regardless of whether
    the tree is rooted inside or outside of the plot (Baker and Chao 2011).
  </li>
  <li>CWD diameter is recorded in cm and length is recorded in m.</li>
  <li>Measure CWD diameter over bark.</li>
  <li>
    Length is only measured for the portion of the CWD that meets the size
    threshold and is within the plot boundary.
  </li>
  <li>
    A cased tape measure is recommended for recording CWD lengths, as they are
    compact and easily retractable.
