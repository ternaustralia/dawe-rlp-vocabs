<strong><p>Additional guidelines</p></strong>
<p>
  The following points are adapted from The National Committee on Soil and
  Terrain (2009) and McKenzie et al. (2008).
</p>
<p style="color: orange">Soil characterization</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Soil characterization should be completed as close as possible to the
      southwest corner of the plot (i.e., outside and immediately adjacent to
      the plot; see Figure 1), but should not result in any disturbance in the
      plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Soil characterization should ideally be conducted by a pedologist, soil
      scientist, or experience soil surveyor. A less experience surveyor should
      collect soil samples that can be characterized back in the lab by a
      pedologist, soil scientist, or experience soil surveyor.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Refer to the Yellow Book for further descriptions and instructions for
      assessing each soil property (The National Committee on Soil and Terrain
      2009).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The preferred soil characterization method is by digging a 1 m+ soil pit.
      The advantages of this approach include easy observation of vertical and
      lateral variation, compacting specimens is avoided, easy sampling of
      undisturbed horizons with little or no contamination, and easy to
      photograph exposures.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consider the alignment of the pit as this is important for good
      photographs of the pit face. Natural sunlight can produce sharp contrasts
      of shade and light that obscure subtle variation in the profile, though
      full sunlight without shadows can be satisfactory. Light cloudy conditions
      offer uniform lighting, which might be best. Orient the pit so that the
      face to be photographed will be illuminated by the sun at the time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The pit should be large enough for comfortable working at the face.
      Depending on final depth, one or more steps (about 0.3 m tread with 0.3 m
      risers) should be left. Pits deeper than 1.5 m require bracing to meet
      occupational health and safety requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      During excavation, protect the soil surface above the face to be described
      and sampled by laying a piece of heavy canvas or plastic sheet at that end
      of the pit. Place it to one side when you begin to collect specimens and
      use it to receive individual specimens as they are removed, before packing
      them for transport to the laboratory.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The face of the soil profile should be picked back to expose the natural
      ped faces where present. A non-reflective black or coloured tape with
      clear depth markings should always be used. Soil profiles are best
      photographed when moist, so they match morphological descriptions – spray
      water on dry profiles from a bottle.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Flash or flood lighting produces an evenly lit photograph, but the
      resulting colors can be unnatural. When pits are deep the bottom of the
      face might receive less light. A reflective screen placed along the base
      of the pit ensures even lighting across the base of the profile. A
      sunscreen made from black cotton provides good shade when the pit cannot
      be aligned as preferred.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Collect samples by progressive excavation of a vertical rectangular
      section, sub-sectioned by depth intervals or soil horizons or both. To
      obtain sufficient specimens from thin layers, it may be necessary to
      collect from a larger cross-sectional area than for the rest of the
      profile. Conversely, this may result in too large a specimen if depth
      intervals are increased deeper in the profile. Do not solve this problem
      by reducing the cross-sectional area of the section. To avoid bias, the
      soil profile should be excavated to a uniform cross-section.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Avoid contamination by incomplete removal of overlying material or by
      failure of side or back walls of the lengthening collection channel. In
      most cases, it is best to start from the base of the profile to minimize
      contamination.

      Every effort should be made to dig a 1 m+ soil pit. However, after three
      failed attempts (due to rock, hardpan, water, etc.), the attempt should be
      abandoned and the reason documented, and soil characterization undertaken
      and/or soil samples collected down to the depth achieved.
    </p>
  </li>

    <p>
      If digging a 1 m+ soil pit cannot be undertaken, other options include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using a core tube or hand auger to collect soils and laying out the
          profile, or
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using a hand auger and collecting a 500 g sample from 10 cm increments
          down the profile to 1 m+.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you need to sample or observe the soil below the bottom of the pit, you
      can do so with a hand auger.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For efficiency, one field surveyor can dig the pit while another locates
      and begins digging the soil sub-sites in different microhabitats (see
      <u>Soil sub-site characterization protoco</u>l).
    </p>

    <p>
      Sampling from existing exposures (e.g., road cuts, gully banks) is
      undesirable because the topsoil is often disturbed, absent, or overlaid
      with other material, and it is difficult to determine how representative
      the exposures are.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Horizons</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      A soil horizon is a layer of soil approximately parallel to the land
      surface, with morphological properties different from layers below and/or
      above it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Horizons may be difficult to name but should be named in the field.
      Opinions formed at the time of description are useful for later reference.
      Even less experienced surveyors should be able to distinguish soil
      horizons.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      With regard to horizon notation, the long-established usage in horizon
      designation is adopted. Emphasis is on factual objective notation rather
      than assumed genesis, as genetic implications are often uncertain and
      difficult to establish.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Horizon codes and description are listed in Appendix O. Refer to pages
      148–159 of the Yellow Book for detailed descriptions (The National
      Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Soil color</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Soil colour is not covered in depth in the Yellow Book. See the Munsell
      Color (2009) for further details.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Munsell Soil Colour Charts are arranged by hue, value and chroma. The hue
      notation of a colour indicates its relation to red, yellow, green, blue
      and purple; the value notation indicates its lightness; and the chroma
      notation indicates its strength (or departure from a neutral of the same
      lightness).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The colours are displayed on individual soil colour charts are of constant
      hue, designated by a symbol in the upper right-hand corner of the chart.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Vertically, as the colours become successively lighter from the bottom to
      the top of the chart by visually equal steps, their value increases.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Horizontally, the colours increase in chroma to the right of the chart and
      become greyer to the left.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Soil samples</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Even a less experienced surveyor should be able to identify the soil
      horizons, in which case sampling across soil horizons should be avoided.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When placing each soil sample into the applicable labelled zip-lock bags,
      take care to minimise disruption to any peds or aggregates. Coarse
      fragment components should be minimised in sample to avoid overfilling the
      bags. If necessary, samples can be sieved in the field using a 2 mm sieve.
