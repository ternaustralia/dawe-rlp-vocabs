<h3 id="pre-requisites-4">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before commencing the survey, the Plot Layout and Selection
Module must be completed.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> must be completed before, during or
after the Soil Module survey. The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> is best
completed by personnel familiar with describing landforms and vegetation
communities.</p></li>
<li><p>The protocol involves the collection and transportation of soil
samples, requiring appropriate scientific permits and approvals.
Movement of soil samples may involve obtaining a biosecurity permit,
which can entail safe packaging, proper labelling, and documentation.
Check with the local authority for specific requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>If the survey involves the Soil sit observation and pit
characterisation protocol or Soil sample pit protocol, it is recommended
to complete these protocols before conducting the Soil bulk density
protocol. Soil bulk density samples are obtained from the side of the
pre-existing soil pit.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-4">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and
experience of personnel, their familiarity with the collection of soil
bulk density samples and the soil type. As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow between 0.5–1 hour to collect bulk density samples and
record the information. Based on accessing the samples from the edge of
a soil pit completed during the Soil site observation and pit
characterisation protocol.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-4">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Completing the Soil bulk density protocol and recording the data
directly into the app can be conducted by a single surveyor.</p></li>
<li><p>Personnel should be familiar with and experienced in using the
equipment and sampling procedure for collecting bulk density samples. If
surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising,
using instruction manuals, and seeking advice before conducting this
protocol.</p></li>

    skos:note """<h3 id="additional-guidelines-4">Additional Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The accuracy of the bulk density method relies on the precise
collection of undisturbed soil in the bulk density ring. Ensure care is
taken when collecting the bulk density samples, so that the total volume
of the ring comprises of the soil sample, without hollows or
voids.</p></li>
<li><p>Accuracy is also influenced by the proportion of coarse fragments
in the soil and where significant compaction occurs as a result of
inserting the corer. Coarse fragments (i.e. soil particles greater than
2 mm in diameter), need to be considered in determining soil bulk
density.</p></li>
<li><p>If coarse fragments contained within any sample are estimated to
constitute greater than 30% of the volume of that sample, then accuracy
levels are compromised, and the sample should be discarded. Try again in
an adjacent area (i.e. another face of the soil pit). However, if coarse
fragment levels are still &gt;30% of the volume of the sample abandon
attempt at this plot.</p></li>
<li><p>If the soils are very dry or have limited clay contents the
process may be enhanced by slight wetting of the soils and leaving them
for a period. This increases the adhesion of the sample to ensure it
remains in the ring. However, over-wetting can alter soil properties,
and should therefore only be used as a last resort.</p></li>
<li><p>Where <em>Soil site observation and pit characterisation</em>
protocol or <em>Soil sample pit</em> protocol soil pit has not been
implemented, bulk density samples can be extracted from a small
sub-surface pit. Dig a pit to the required depth (i.e. 10 cm or 20 cm,
respectively) and of sufficient size to accommodate the soil core frame,
and sample as for steps 3–18 above. Ensure that no soil falls into the
pit from the upper layer/s. When removing the ring ensure that no soil
material from upper layer/s falls into the ring.</p></li>
</ul>

Bulk density
    samples collected in small soil pit</p>
    <ul>
<li><p>If the collecting agency does not have access to required
laboratory facilities, the bulk density samples collected as part of the
survey process need to be suitably packaged and then forwarded to a
certified laboratory for analysis.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="post-field-survey-tasks">Post-field survey tasks</h1>
<h2 id="laboratory-procedures">Laboratory procedures</h2>
<h3 id="sample-processing">Sample processing</h3>
<p>Soil samples collected as part of the Soil sample pit, Soil sub-pit
(Enhanced and Standard) or Soil site observation and pit
characterisation protocols should be air or oven dried unless special
conditions have been encountered (e.g. anaerobic or acid sulfate soils)
or special sampling procedures specified (e.g. field moist soil for
incubation or mineralisation). The aim of drying soil is to reduce the
water content and prevent chemical and biological reactions prior to
analysis (McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On return to the lab, dry all samples, either air-dried or
oven-dried at 40°C until dry. Drying time will depend on soil type and
moisture content, for over-dried, allow between 24–72 hours.</p></li>
<li><p>If air-drying samples, cloth specimen bags are good for rapid and
convenient air-drying. Protect samples from direct sunlight, rain,
condensation, dust and vermin, and ensure there is good
ventilation.</p></li>
<li><p>Place specimens on a flat, clean surface that is above ground.
Racks of metal-mesh trays maximise ventilation and minimise space.
Specimens in cloth bags can remain sealed but those in plastic bags will
have to be opened, and this creates a risk of contamination. Most
specimens require only 5–7 days of air-drying but wet specimens might
need more and should be separated from the rest. Soils that hold
together well and are difficult to grind after drying should be broken
down before or during air-drying. Once air-dried, specimens can be
packaged for transport to the laboratory or processed on-site.</p></li>
<li><p>Once dried, place each sample in an approved standardised
airtight storage container (e.g. 1 L Cospak A572) clearly labelled with
a voucher barcode label corresponding to the soil sample, include an
identical barcode label inside the container (voucher label left on
backing sheet, cut out and placed in a small zip-lock bag) (see <a href="#sample-labelling">Sample labelling</a> below for instructions on
assigning sample barcodes).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="metagenomics-samples">Metagenomics samples</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Inspect and change silica gel granules when necessary, working in
a well-ventilated area and wear a respirator mask and disposable gloves,
see <a href="#sample-curation">Sample curation</a> below for further
details.</p></li>
<li><p>Temperature fluctuations may degrade eDNA, store metagenomic
samples in a cool, dry and stable environment when transporting from the
field to a laboratory.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bulk-density-samples">Bulk density samples</h4>
<p>To determine the bulk density of soils (mg/m<sup>3</sup>), the sample
volume is determined by simple measurement of the dimensions of a coring
ring. If the sampling procedure is followed rigorously, the volume of
all samples will be identical (as the volume of all rings is identical),
so sample volume will only need to be determined for an initial sample.
The soil from each core sample is removed, oven-dried and weighed
(McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2002). Where suitable processing facilities
are available, follow the steps in <a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a> to determine bulk density,
then follow the steps below to record bulk density calculations in the
Monitor app.</p>

<li><p>Sub-pit sample vouchers should only be scanned and affixed to
long-term storage containers once samples have been completely dried.
Voucher labels should be attached to an approved standardised airtight
sample storage container (e.g. 1 L Cospack A572) and an identical
barcode label should also be placed inside the container (voucher label
to be left attached to the backing sheet, cut out and placed in a small

the mix has been reached and it needs to be replaced with fresh
silica.</p></li>
<li><p>To replace silica, prepare a safe, well-ventilated working area.
Using the required PPE, empty spent silica into a suitably sized empty

<h1 id="data-submission">Data submission</h1>
<p>Data from the Soils Module is collected in the field using the
Monitor app. Data entry is completed in the app, photos are taken using
the app (or later linked if taken on other devices), and sample barcodes
are scanned in the app to link sample numbers to the unique data. All
data is checked for correctness and completeness in the app before it is
submitted.</p>
<p>Once all data is finalised, and marked as completed, the data is
submitted from the Monitor app to the staging server by an explicit user
action. If the device is offline at the time, the data will be pushed as
soon as it is reconnected to a network (i.e. either back in mobile phone
range or a wi-fi network). Once data reaches the staging server it is
prepared in an export interface for delivery to the Biodiversity Data
Repository. DCCEEW is then responsible for managing the data. In the
future, it is anticipated that data curation tools will be made
available to project personnel.</p>
<h1 id="data-use-and-reason-for-collection">Data use and reason for
collection</h1>
<h2 id="data-use-to-date">Data use to date</h2>
<p>Soil chemistry and bulk density data from all of TERN Ecosystem
Surveillance plots are helping to improve the national scale soil maps
developed as part of the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia. The
incorporation of TERN Ecosystem Surveillance soil data (Sparrow <em>et
al.</em> 2020) are helping to improve estimations and reduce
uncertainties by addressing shortfalls in data availability and quality
(Grundy <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<h2 id="future-use-of-the-data">Future use of the data</h2>
<p>Data collected as part of the Soils Module can contribute to regional
or national soil mapping and assessment of land productivity and can
help overcome current gaps related to soils knowledge and mapping across
Australia. The soils description information, including slope, landform
element, erosion (accelerated erosion, rather than natural),
microrelief, drainage, disturbance, and soil surface condition (when
dry), can provide significant background information on the plot
history, topography, position in the landscape and the relationship
between the soils, vegetation and fauna. This information can increase
general understanding about soils and landforms across the country and
contribute to research into the relationships between soils and other
components of the ecosystem, such as vegetation.</p>
<p>The data collected as part of the Soils Module can contribute towards
the National Soil Condition Monitoring Program (NSCMP) to better
understand soil carbon and pH change in relation to different
environments, land uses and land management practices, and provide a
more comprehensive coverage across Australian landscapes. Analyses of
soil samples will greatly enhance the level of knowledge, particularly
nutrient and carbon levels, and consequently the understanding of
Australian soils, especially in areas outside of the agricultural zone,
and how they will most likely respond to climate change and different
management regimes.</p>
<p>Bulk density measures are necessary to quantify important soil
parameters per unit area, such as carbon content (e.g. tonnes of carbon
per hectare). A measure of carbon content can indicate how soil carbon
changes with different agricultural practices and management activities,
such as stubble retention (Luo <em>et al.</em> 2010), as well as from
other interventions, such as restoration (Prior <em>et al.</em> 2015).
Consequently, bulk density measures may provide important insights into
the effectiveness of different management interventions.</p>
<p>Strategies to assess soil quality are needed to be able to protect
soil from degradation and to manage it sustainably (Cotching and Kidd
2010). Understanding soil properties can help assess the ecosystem
services provided by soils (Luo <em>et al.</em> 2010; Fossey <em>et
al.</em> 2020), determine soil quality and inform soil management
(Cotching and Kidd 2010), help assess and manage soil erosion, and track
changes in erosion levels with different management practices (Cork
<em>et al.</em> 2012), be used to assess changes following development,
such as mining (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2018), and provide a warning of
land degradation and inappropriate land management (Grealish <em>et
al.</em> 2011).</p>
<p>Collection of metagenomic soil samples provides the opportunity to
investigate the diversity and abundance of soil biota (e.g. bacteria,
fungi), and identify traces of above-ground flora and fauna. Collection
of soil samples for eDNA analysis can help assess patterns of microbial
diversity with differing land management practices, including in
degraded systems or those that have been restored (Liddicoat <em>et
al.</em> 2019; van der Heyde <em>et al.</em> 2020). It can also be used
to assess restoration against competition criteria (van der Heyde <em>et
al.</em> 2020) and help track the success of interventions, and inform
on the outcomes for human health (Gellie <em>et al.</em> 2017; Mills
<em>et al.</em> 2017; Yan <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>

<p>The presence of coarse fragments (i.e. particles &gt;2mm diameter) in
soil has a significant effect on bulk density. If the sample contains
coarse fragments, the mass and volume of coarse fragments, gross bulk
density of the soil with coarse fragments, and bulk density of the
fine-earth fraction (i.e. bulk density of soil without the coarse
fragment component) need to be considered (McKenzie <em>et al.</em>
2002).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>After drying and cooling (see above), separate the coarse
fragment component of each sample by sieving through a 2 mm
sieve.</p></li>
<li><p>Weigh the fine earth and container (W<sub>4</sub>) and coarse
fragments and container (W<sub>5</sub>) of each sample
separately.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the volume of the coarse fragments (V<sub>2</sub>) of
each sample by displacement of water.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the of the gross bulk density of each sample using the
following equation:</p>

mark out the plot boundary and define the current plot and visit in the
Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the Soils Module and then the Soil bulk density
protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Select ‘field’ for the <em>survey variant</em>. The <em>start
date</em> will be automatically recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>observers</em>. Select existing observers from the
dropdown list or enter new ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Press the <em>choose on map</em> button to record soil sample pit
<em>location</em>. Record the <em>collection method</em> used to record
the location (e.g. differential GNSS).</p></li>
<li><p>The app will automatically record the <em>start date</em> and
<em>time</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>soil pit ID</em>. This is the soil pit the bulk
density samples will be collected from.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear litter and vegetation from a 30 x 30 cm area of the soil
surface along an edge of the pit without disturbing the soil to any
degree.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the plastic caps from a bulk density core ring and put the
ring, bevelled edge down, into the soil corer frame.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the frame over the cleared area. Using the mallet gently
tap the frame into the soil until the top edge of the ring is a few
millimetres below the soil surface. Depending on the presence and size
of any soil coarse fragments the ring may need to be inserted further.
If the soil surface is uneven, an estimate of the mid-point should be
used. In order to avoid chipping or bending the cylinder on rocks or
other unseen hard material (and thereby changing the volume of the ring)
do not use excessive force when tapping the frame into the
soil.</p></li>

<li><p>Using a spatula or knife, carefully trim the soil at the exposed
end of the ring until it is level with the rim of the ring. Ensure there
are no hollows (i.e. the soil level does not go below the rim of the
ring), or that the soil does not protrude beyond the rim of the ring. If
the soil is clay, slightly wet the soil using a spray bottle and
deionised/distilled water to assist to trim the soil flush with the ring
ends. Care should be taken to not over-wet the soils as this may affect
the volume through filling voids or expanding shrink/swell
clays.</p></li>

gravel or air spaces (meaning the volume of the soil is not identical to
the volume of the ring). If the soil is not level, reject the sample and
repeat the process until a suitable sample is obtained. If an accurate
volume cannot be obtained after three attempts along the other edges of
the soil pit, then try another location within the plot that is
representative of the soil pit location.</p></li>
