      that the soil does not protrude beyond the rim of the ring. If the soil is
      clay, slightly wet the soil using a spray bottle and deionized/distilled
      water to assist to trim the soil flush with the ring ends. Care should be

      repeat the process until a suitable sample is obtained. If an accurate

<strong><p>Additional guidelines</p></strong>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The accuracy of the bulk density method relies on the precise collection
      of undisturbed soil in the bulk density ring. Ensure care is taken when
      collecting the bulk density samples, so that the total volume of the ring
      comprises of the soil sample, without hollows or voids.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Accuracy is also influenced by the proportion of coarse fragments in the
      soil and where significant compaction occurs as a result of inserting the
      corer. Coarse fragments (i.e., soil particles greater than 2 mm in
      diameter), need to be considered in determining soil bulk density.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If coarse fragments contained within any sample are estimated to
      constitute greater than 30% of the volume of that sample, then accuracy
      levels are compromised, and the sample should be discarded. Try again in
      an adjacent area (i.e., another face of the soil point). However, if
      coarse fragment levels are still &gt;30% of the volume of the sample after
      three attempts, try somewhere else within the plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the collecting agency does not have access to required laboratory
      facilities, the bulk density samples collected as part of the survey
      process need to be suitably packaged and then forwarded to a certified
      laboratory for analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For sub-surface soil samples (i.e., depths of 10–20 or 20–30 cm), dig a
      pit to the required depth (i.e., 10 cm or 20 cm, respectively) and of
      sufficient size to accommodate the soil core frame, and sample as for
      steps 7–17 above. Ensure that no soil falls into the pit from the upper
      layer/s. When removing the ring (step 10 above) ensure that no soil
      material from upper layer/s falls into the ring.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the soils are very dry or have limited clay contents the process may be
      enhanced by slight wetting of the soils and leaving them for a period.
      This increases the adhesion of the sample to ensure it remains in the
      ring. However, over-wetting can alter soil properties, and should
      therefore only be used as a last resort.
    </p>

  <strong>Post-field survey tasks</strong>
</p>
<p style="color: orange">Sample processing</p>
<p>
  To determine the bulk density of soils, the sample volume is determined by
  simple measurement of the dimensions of a coring ring. If the sampling
  procedure is followed rigorously, the volume of all samples will be identical
  (as the volume of all rings is identical), so sample volume will only need to
  be determined for an initial sample. The soil from each core sample is
  removed, oven-dried and weighed (McKenzie et al. 2002). Where suitable
  processing facilities are available, following the steps below to determine
  bulk density. Otherwise, forward intact soil cores to a suitable laboratory to
  be processed.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Measure, with calipers, the internal dimensions (diameter = L1; length =
      L2) of a coring ring in meters to determine the volume (V1). Each
      dimension should be measured several times
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure the soil level of each intact core is trimmed level with the ends
      of the coring ring. Trim using a sharp knife if necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Weigh a dry, oven proof container (e.g., an aluminum dish) with a
      laboratory balance with accuracy to ±0.01 g (10 mg; weight W1) for each
      core.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take each core and push all the soil out of the coring ring into an
      oven-proof container. Carefully clean all soil out of each coring ring.
      Weigh each container and soil (W2).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Dry the soil in the containers in a well-ventilated oven at 105°C until
      the weight is constant (usually 24– 48 hours).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Cool in a desiccator before weighing each container and oven-dry soil
      (W3).
    </p>
  </li>

      Calculate the bulk density of each sample using the following equation:

<p style="color: orange">Samples containing coarse fragments</p>
<p>
  The presence of coarse fragments (i.e., particles &gt;2mm diameter) in soil
  has a significant effect on bulk density. If the sample contains coarse
  fragments, the mass and volume of coarse fragments, gross bulk density of the
  soil with coarse fragments, and bulk density of the fine-earth fraction (i.e.,
  bulk density of soil without the coarse fragment component) need to be
  considered (McKenzie et al. 2002).
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      After drying and cooling (see above), separate the coarse fragment
      component of each sample by sieving the through a 2 mm sieve.

    <p>
      Weigh the fine earth and container (W4) and coarse fragments and container
      (W5) of each sample separately.

      Determine the volume of the coarse fragments (V2) of each sample by
      displacement of water.
