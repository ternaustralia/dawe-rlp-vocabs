<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before commencing the survey, the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout Module</a> must be completed.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> must be completed before, during or
after the Soil Module survey. The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> is best
completed by personnel familiar with describing the landforms and
vegetation communities.</p></li>
<li><p>The protocol involves the collection and transportation of soil
samples, requiring appropriate scientific permits and approvals.
Movement of soil samples may involve obtaining a biosecurity permit,
which can entail safe packaging, proper labelling, and documentation.
Check with the local authority for specific requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>If the survey involves the Soil sit observation and pit
characterisation protocol or Soil sample pit protocol, it is recommended
to complete these protocols before conducting the Soil bulk density
protocol. Soil bulk density samples are obtained from the side of the
pre-existing soil pit.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-4">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and
experience of personnel, their familiarity with the collection of soil
bulk density samples and the soil type. As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow between 30 minutes to one hour to collect bulk density
samples and record the information. Based on accessing the samples from
the edge of a soil pit completed during the Soil site observation and
pit characterisation protocol.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-4">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Completing the Soil bulk density protocol and recording the data
directly into the app can be conducted by a single surveyor. </p></li>
<li><p>Personnel should be familiar with and experienced in using the
equipment and sampling procedure for collecting bulk density samples. If
surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising,
using instruction manuals, and seeking advice before conducting this
protocol. </p></li>

    <h3 id="additional-guidelines-4">Additional guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The accuracy of the bulk density method relies on the precise
collection of undisturbed soil in the bulk density ring. Ensure care is
taken when collecting the bulk density samples, so that the total volume
of the ring comprises of the soil sample, without hollows or
voids.</p></li>
<li><p>Accuracy is also influenced by the proportion of coarse fragments
in the soil and where significant compaction occurs as a result of
inserting the corer. Coarse fragments (i.e. soil particles greater than
2 mm in diameter), need to be considered in determining soil bulk
density.</p></li>
<li><p>If coarse fragments contained within any sample are estimated to
constitute greater than 30% of the volume of that sample, then accuracy
levels are compromised, and the sample should be discarded. Try again in
an adjacent area (i.e. another face of the soil pit). However, if coarse
fragment levels are still &gt;30% of the volume of the sample abandon
attempt at this plot.</p></li>
<li><p>If the soils are very dry or have limited clay contents the
process may be enhanced by slight wetting of the soils and leaving them
for a period. This increases the adhesion of the sample to ensure it
remains in the ring. However, over-wetting can alter soil properties,
and should therefore only be used as a last resort.</p></li>
<li><p>Where <em>Soil site observation and pit characterisation</em>
protocol or <em>Soil sample pit</em> protocol soil pit has not been
implemented, bulk density samples can be extracted from a small
sub-surface pit. Dig a pit to the required depth (i.e. 10 cm or 20 cm,
respectively) and of sufficient size to accommodate the soil core frame,
and sample as for steps 3 - 18 above. Ensure that no soil falls into the
pit from the upper layer/s. When removing the ring ensure that no soil
material from upper layer/s falls into the ring.</p></li>
</ul>

Bulk density
samples collected in small soil pit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the collecting agency does not have access to required
laboratory facilities, the bulk density samples collected as part of the
survey process need to be suitably packaged and then forwarded to a
certified laboratory for analysis.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="post-field-survey-tasks">Post-field survey tasks</h1>
<h2 id="sample-processing">Sample processing</h2>
<p>Soil samples collected as part of the Soil sample pit, Soil sub-pit
(enhanced and standard) or Soil site observation and pit
characterisation protocols should be air or oven dried unless special
conditions have been encountered (e.g. anaerobic or acid sulfate soils)
or special sampling procedures specified (e.g. field moist soil for
incubation or mineralisation). The aim of drying soil is to reduce the
water content and prevent chemical and biological reactions prior to
analysis (McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On return to the lab, dry all samples, either air-dried or
oven-dried at 40°C until dry. Drying time will depend on soil type and
moisture content, for over-dried, allow between 24 – 72 hours.</p></li>
<li><p>If air-drying samples, cloth specimen bags are good for rapid and
convenient air-drying. Protect samples from direct sunlight, rain,
condensation, dust and vermin, and ensure there is good
ventilation.</p></li>
<li><p>Place specimens on a flat, clean surface that is above ground.
Racks of metal-mesh trays maximise ventilation and minimise space.
Specimens in cloth bags can remain sealed but those in plastic bags will
have to be opened, and this creates a risk of contamination. Most
specimens require only 5– 7 days of air-drying but wet specimens might
need more and should be separated from the rest. Soils that hold
together well and are difficult to grind after drying should be broken
down before or during air-drying. Once air-dried, specimens can be
packaged for transport to the laboratory or processed on-site.</p></li>
<li><p>Once dried, place each sample in an approved standardised
airtight storage container (e.g. 1 L Cospak A572) clearly labelled with
an voucher barcode label corresponding to the soil sample, include an
identical barcode label inside the container (adhesive surface folded
onto itself and placed in a small zip-lock bag).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="metagenomics-samples">Metagenomics
samples</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Inspect and change silica gel granules when necessary, working in
a well-ventilated area and wear a respirator mask and disposable gloves,
see <a href="#sample-curation">Sample curation</a> below for further
details.</p></li>
<li><p>Temperature fluctuations may degrade eDNA, store metagenomic
samples in a cool, dry and stable environment when transporting from the
field to a laboratory.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="bulk-density-samples">Bulk density
samples</h4>
<p>To determine the bulk density of soils (mg/m<sup>3</sup>), the sample
volume is determined by simple measurement of the dimensions of a coring
ring. If the sampling procedure is followed rigorously, the volume of
all samples will be identical (as the volume of all rings is identical),
so sample volume will only need to be determined for an initial sample.
The soil from each core sample is removed, oven-dried and weighed
(McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2002). Forward intact and sealed soil cores to
a suitable laboratory to be processed. Where suitable processing
facilities are available, follow the steps in <a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a> to determine bulk density.</p>
<h2 id="sample-curation">Sample curation</h2>
<p>For long-term storage of soil samples see the Lodging EMSA Specimens
and Samples information sheet.</p>
<h3 id="metagenomic-samples">Metagenomic samples</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A change in colour (usually after 2–3 days) of the
self-indicating granules reveals that the moisture absorbing capacity of
the mix has been reached and it needs to be replaced with fresh
silica.</p></li>
<li><p>To replace silica, prepare a safe, well-ventilated working area.
Using the required PPE, empty spent silica into a suitably sized empty
airtight receptacle (e.g. 20 L bucket with lid).</p></li>
<li><p>Replace ½ a cup of mixed new silica granules into relevant zip
lock bags and reseal.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not discard the spent silica. It can be reactivated by drying
in an oven at 110°C for 2 hours or until the indicator colour reverts.
Ovens used for food preparation are not suitable for this process and
PPE recommendations should be followed at all times when handling
silica. To avoid contamination, reactivated silica should not be used
for metagenomic samples.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="oven-drying-silica-gel-granules">Oven-drying silica gel
granules</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Care should be taken when working with silica gel granules as
exposure to fine silica dust can cause respiratory illness and disease.
Although the risk of generating silica dust is low, ensure you work in a
well-ventilated area and wear a respirator mask and disposable
gloves.</p></li>
<li><p>Place used silica gel granules into a cloth bag (e.g. large
calico bag, pillow case) to prevent silica dust being blown into the
surrounding environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Flatten the cloth bag containing the silica gel granules onto a
suitable oven tray and place into a cool oven to slowly dry it without
overheating.</p></li>
<li><p>Drying time in the oven will vary depending on moisture
content.</p></li>
<li><p>When the indicator granules have returned to their original
colour the silica gel granules are ready to be reused. These silica
granules can be used for vouching specimens in the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1f2ac884-2177-403a-a6c3-27e109b1fc95">Plant Tissue

<p>Bulk density samples containing coarse fragments:</p>
<p>The presence of coarse fragments (i.e. particles &gt;2mm diameter) in
soil has a significant effect on bulk density. If the sample contains
coarse fragments, the mass and volume of coarse fragments, gross bulk
density of the soil with coarse fragments, and bulk density of the
fine-earth fraction (i.e. bulk density of soil without the coarse
fragment component) need to be considered (McKenzie <em>et al.</em>
2002).</p>
