<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols</h2>
<p>The Soils Module covers the procedures and guidelines to conduct four
survey protocols. The protocols are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Soil Sub-Pit and Soil Metagenomics</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/9a1ab016-60d6-4876-a751-b25ccb734c2d">Enhanced Protocol</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/5d12a157-61a0-42e6-b23d-895018974c67">Standard Protocol</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1c83a60d-12e5-4bb3-b876-7eb97da79fa9">Soil Sample Pit</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/8f00b7c6-34b4-4203-8dcc-4be47f21d7db">Soil Site Observation and Pit Characterisation</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d9e6739a-c2dd-4619-be43-1251449a6436">Soil Bulk Density</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Soil Sub-Pit and Soil Metagenomics protocol includes the
procedures and guidelines for collecting soil surface and upper soil
samples in a plot; including surface sampling to 3 cm, capturing a
photographic record of microhabitat sampled and soil profile, exposing
the soil profile to a depth of 30 cm, collecting 10 cm increment soil
samples down the soil profile, scanning sample barcodes and post-field
survey processing of soil samples. The protocol has been split into two
survey efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/9a1ab016-60d6-4876-a751-b25ccb734c2d">Enhanced Protocol</a> – collection of metagenomic soil surface
samples and soil sub-pit samples at nine locations with differing
microhabitats (e.g. bare ground, dense litter, sparse vegetation cover,
dense vegetation cover) within the plot. Five soil sub-pits are located
within a 25 x 25 m soil sub-pit zone in the southwest corner of the plot
(<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>), the remaining four soil sub-pits are scattered throughout
the rest of the plot.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/5d12a157-61a0-42e6-b23d-895018974c67">Standard Protocol</a> – collection of metagenomic soil surface sample
and soil sub-pit samples at a single location, outside the southwest
corner of the plot (<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1c83a60d-12e5-4bb3-b876-7eb97da79fa9">Soil Sample Pit</a> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines
for collecting soil samples from a 1 m+ soil pit in a plot, including
exposing the soil profile to 1 m+, sampling the soil profile in 10 cm
increments, scanning sample barcodes and post-field survey processing of
soil samples.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/8f00b7c6-34b4-4203-8dcc-4be47f21d7db">Soil Site Observation and Pit Characterisation</a> protocol includes
the procedures and guidelines for describing aspects of the land surface
around the soil pit, including slope, landform element, erosion,
microrelief, drainage, disturbance, and soil surface condition (when
dry), characterising the soil profile by exposing the profile to a depth
of 1 m+ or to depth of limiting layer, capturing a photographic record
of the soil pit, identifying the soil horizons, recording the physical
properties of the soil within each horizon, assigning an <a href="https://www.soilscienceaustralia.org.au/asc/">Australian Soil
Classification</a>, collecting soil samples from 10 cm increments, and
post-field survey processing of soil samples.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d9e6739a-c2dd-4619-be43-1251449a6436">Soil Bulk Density</a> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines
for collecting soil core samples at 10 cm increments down to 30 cm from
the edge of the soil pit (<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>), plus additional locations if
required, sealing the core samples, and post-field survey processing of
soil core samples.</p>
<p>Protocols from the Soils Module can be conducted using either a
single protocol or a combination of protocols based on the specific
requirements and objectives of a project. <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d9e6739a-c2dd-4619-be43-1251449a6436">Soil Bulk Density</a> protocol
works well with either <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1c83a60d-12e5-4bb3-b876-7eb97da79fa9">Soil Sample Pit</a> protocol or <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/8f00b7c6-34b4-4203-8dcc-4be47f21d7db">Soil Site Observation and Pit Characterisation</a> protocol, utilising the already excavated soil
pit to obtain bulk density samples.</p>
<p>The Soil Sub-Pit and Soil Metagenomics protocol procedure allows for
the surveyor to incorporate metagenomics sampling into the soil sub-pit
sampling workflow. Within the Monitor app, there is the option to
collect soil sub-pits without metagenomics, however it is encouraged
that practitioners collect metagenomics and soil sub-pit together.</p>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Large areas of Australia have limited or no soils information.
Investigation of soils has typically focused on agricultural zones,
resulting in soil characteristics for large areas of the country being
interpolated from sparse data (Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020).
Consequently, collecting land surface descriptions and soil
characterisations will help to alleviate this paucity of information in
and improve the reliability of the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia
(SLGA) and the Australian National Soil Information System (ANSIS). Both
the SLGA and ANSIS meet the demands of a broad range of users, including
urban and regional planners, natural resources managers, scientists,
engineers, educational institutions, and farming and community groups
(McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2012; Grundy <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>Nationally standardised soil monitoring protocols are critical for
understanding how Australia’s soil resources are being affected by land
use and climate change. Soil is a fundamental natural resource and its
condition and use have a major impact on the health of ecosystems, the
economy and human health. Good quality soil data is required to support
decisions related to local, regional, national and international issues
such as food security, environmental sustainability, carbon and
greenhouse gas accounting, and water availability and use (Grealish
<em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to basic characterisation, the
methods outlined here collect soil samples for future analysis (e.g. DNA
metabarcoding and chemical analyses), and therefore help to create a
library of soil samples from locations across Australia.</p>
<p>Data collection for the Soils Module follows a standardised manner
using the Monitor app. Standardised data collection and reporting of
methods and results enables study replication, more robust comparisons
among studies, comparability over time, facilitates national and
international reviews, and leads to improved research and management
outcomes for soil and land resources.</p>
<p>Soil metagenomic samples provide the opportunity to understand what
organisms are present at plots and provide an indication on their
abundance. Microbial inhabitants of soils are important to ecosystem and
planetary functions, yet there are large gaps in our knowledge of their
diversity and ecology. The collection of soil metagenomics samples
provides opportunity to contribute to the <em>Biomes of Australian Soil
Environments</em> (BASE) project, which has generated a database of
microbial diversity with associated metadata across extensive
environmental gradients at continental scale (Bissett <em>et al.</em>
2016).</p>
<p>Soil sub-pits are sampled to enable basic follow-up physical
descriptions of the soil and can be analysed by a number of different
methods (e.g. wet chemistry, mid infrared spectrometry or near infrared
spectroscopy). The sampling can be at a single location (standard
protocol) or nine locations (enhanced protocol) to capture the soil
diversity across a plot. As part of the enhanced protocol, five soil
sub-pits are located within a 25 x 25 m soil sub-pit zone in the
southwest corner of the plot (<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>), allowing consistency with
various national soil research programs and monitoring protocols.</p>
<p>The physical description of the soil profile from a soil pit, as well
as the soil site observations, are important for both baseline
descriptions and for comparisons between plots (NCST 2009). The protocol
uses the standards outlined in the Yellow Book (NCST 2009), with soils
classified using the standard Australian Soil Classification (Isbell and
The National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2021). This approach ensures
that the collectable data is consistent and compatible for use in
digital soil mapping, accessible through virtual national databases such
as the Australian National Soil Information System (ANSIS), and can be
utilised in predictive modelling (McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>
<p>Soil bulk density measures are collected so that important soil
parameters of the plot can be quantified per unit area, particularly
carbon content (e.g. tonnes of carbon per hectare). The precise
collection of undisturbed soil in bulk density rings is used to ensure
accurate calculations.</p>
<p>In preparation of the Soils Module, relevant national and state soil
monitoring programs and their objectives have been considered,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CSIRO’s National Soil Condition Monitoring for Soil pH and Soil
Carbon (Grealish et al. 2011)</p></li>
<li><p>CSIRO’s National Soil Carbon Research Programme (SCaRP; Sanderman
et al. 2011)</p></li>
<li><p>Tasmania’s Soil Condition Evaluation and Monitoring
(SCEAM)</p></li>
<li><p>New South Wales’ Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (MER)
Program (Bowman et al. 2009)</p></li>
<li><p>The Soil pH Monitoring Network for the Western Australian
Wheatbelt (Holmes et al. 2011).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are similarities in approach, particularly with the soil
variables measured and collection methods of soil samples. Approaches
are complementary, and data can be shared to provide larger improved
datasets for interpretation (Grealish <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;

    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>This Soils Module provides the procedures and guidelines for
describing and characterising the soils within the plot. It facilitates
the conversion of soil properties into volumetric measures and enables
the collection of soil samples for various downstream laboratory tests
and analyses, including soil chemistry texts and soil metagenomics
analysis. The soil description and survey procedures align with the
national guidelines for surveying land and vegetation, including the
<em>Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook</em> (colloquially
known as the Yellow Book; The National Committee on Soils and Terrain
2009), <em>Guidelines for Surveying Soil and Land Resources</em>
(commonly referred to as the Blue Book; McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008)
and the <em>Australian Soil Classification</em> (Isbell and The National
Committee on Soil and Terrain 2021).</p>
<p>The soil descriptions and survey procedures in this module adhere to
the third edition of the Yellow Book (NCST 2009). This ensures
consistency with various organisations in Australia that are involved
with soil and land survey investigations (Grealish et al. 2011;
Sanderman et al. 2011; McKenzie et al. 2012). The Yellow Book sets
standards for terminology and methodology in surveying all components of
land resources across Australia (NCST 2009). Guidance on practical
surveying issues related to soil and land resources is based on the
second edition of the Blue Book (McKenzie et al. 2008).</p>
<p>As part of the Soil Module, important land surface aspects of the
plot are described, in addition to the descriptive information collected
in the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a>. These aspects include slope, landform
element and pattern, erosion (accelerated erosion, rather than natural),
microrelief, drainage, disturbance, and soil surface condition (when
dry). These observations provide valuable background information
regarding the plot history, topography, and position within the
landscape. Additionally, they facilitate the interpretation of soil pit
results, contribute to the understanding of soil development and
morphology, and enable the assessment of relationships between soils,
vegetation, and fauna.</p>
<p>When a pedologist or experienced soil surveyor undertakes soil pit
characterisation from a soil pit, the exposed soil profile can be
characterised <em>in situ</em> to derive an understanding of the
physical properties of the soil down the profile, including the
arrangement of soil horizons, texture, mottles, coarse fragments,
structure, and segregations. Parts of this process are essential and
must be undertaken in the field, whereas other parts can be completed at
a later stage from samples collected in the field.</p>
<p>Although a pedologist can assess the soil samples at a later date to
produce a profile for characterisation, completing the characterisation
in the field is the model approach. This is because certain physical
properties may be challenging to describe accurately or may not be
possible to assess solely from samples alone. Deciding whether to engage
a pedologist or an experienced soil surveyor is an important survey
design consideration and will ultimately depend on the scope and desired
outcome of a project.</p>
<p>The Soil sub-pits protocol involves soil sampling 30 cm deep soil
sub-pits targeting microhabitats within the plot. The samples are
maintained individually to assess soil variability of the microhabitats.
Both the soil pit and sub-pit samples enable follow-up physical
descriptions of the soil and soil chemistry analysis. See McKenzie et
al. (2008) for further examples and details of analyses for soil
classification.</p>
<p>Collection of metagenomic soil samples provides the opportunity to
investigate the diversity and abundance of soil biota (e.g. bacteria,
fungi), and identify traces of above-ground flora and fauna. To ensure
soil metagenomic analysis is robust and reliable and that detections of
soil biota or traces of above-ground flora and fauna are obtained,
certain aspects of soil sampling need to be considered, including
sampling time, location, season, volume, mixing, composition,
replication, handling and storage (Pasternak et al. 2019). Researchers
and practitioners undertaking the Soils Module are encouraged to collect
metagenomics samples. For little time and investment, the samples
provide the opportunity for downstream metagenomics analysis to
investigate the diversity and abundance of soil biota (e.g. bacteria,
fungi), and identify traces of above-ground flora and fauna.</p>
<p>A measure of the bulk density of the soil is necessary to quantify
volumetric measures of important soil parameters, particularly carbon
content (e.g. tonnes of carbon within a depth of 0-30 cm per hectare).
To ensure a reliable measure, multiple samples should be collected
across the plot in different surface substrate classes and at different
distances from trees or shrubs. If this is beyond the scope of the
initial survey process, an indicative measure of soil bulk density for
each plot should still be collected to enable interested parties to
convert the soil properties of the plot to volumetric measures.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the Soil site observation and pit
characterisation protocol are undertaken at every plot during a baseline
assessment to describe, measure and sample the soil profile, and only
during repeat visits if the soil classification lacks analytical and/or
morphological data, or if the soils are variable across the plot.
Pedologists and experienced soil surveyors should be able to undertake
the protocol and collect detailed soil profile descriptions in the
field, while less experienced field surveyors can undertake the Soil
sample pit protocol collecting samples at a standard interval from the
soil profile for a more detailed description back in the lab by a
pedologist or experienced soil surveyor. The Soil site observation and
pit characterisation protocol is recommended to be undertaken at the
same time as vegetation modules (e.g. <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics Module</a>, <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover Module</a>)
to enable vegetation analyses to consider contemporaneous soil
characteristics (Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
