  The Soils module covers the procedures and guidelines of six field protocols
  (summarized in Table 2). This includes a plot soil description protocol, two
  soil profile protocols, a soil bulk density protocol, a rapid soil sampling
  protocol aimed at conservation practitioners that need to undertake soil
  chemistry monitoring, and a soil metagenomics protocol.

  sampling location, type of sampling, and approximate survey time for each
  protocol

  All six protocols include procedures and guidelines for recording data and
  scanning sample barcodes directly into the App. All data fields relating to
  soil properties have a drop-down list with available responses. Predictive
  text can be used to filter these lists to narrow results and speed up data
  entry. Indicative locations of the soil sampling locations are illustrated in
  Figure 1 and Figure 2.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Plot soil description</strong> – The Plot soil description
      protocol covers the procedures for describing important aspects of the
      soil within the plot, including plot identification and location details,
      slope, landform element and pattern, erosion, microrelief, drainage,
      disturbance, and soil surface condition (when dry). Although some of these
      soil description variables are also described in the Plot description
      module, it is important to record them in the Soils module relative to the
      soil characterization pit.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Soil pit characterization</strong> – The Soil pit characterization
      protocol covers the procedures and guidelines for characterizing the upper
      soil profile, including exposing the profile to a depth of 1 m+ at the
      southwest corner of the plot (Figure 1), capturing a photographic record
      of profile, identifying the soil horizons, recording the physical
      properties of the soil within each horizon, collecting soil samples from
      10 cm increments, taking care not to sample across horizons, and post-
      field survey processing and storage of soil samples.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is recommended that the Plot soil description and Soil pit
      characterization protocols are undertaken at every plot during a baseline
      assessment to describe, measure and sample the soil profile, and only
      during repeat visits if the soil classification lacks analytical and/or
      morphological data, or if the soils are variable across the plot.
      Pedologists and experienced soil surveyors should be able to undertake
      both protocols and collect detailed soil profile descriptions in the
      field, while less experienced field surveyors should note plot- based
      observations and distinguish soil horizons to their best ability and
      collect samples for a more detailed description back in the lab by a
      pedologist or experienced soil surveyor. The Plot soil description and
      Soil pit characterization protocols are recommended to be undertaken at
      the same time vegetation modules (e.g. Floristics, Cover) to enable
      vegetation analyses to consider contemporaneous soil characteristics
      (Sparrow et al. 2020).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Soil sub-site samples</strong> – The Soil sub-site
      characterization protocol covers the procedures and guidelines for
      collecting soil samples to capture variability in the upper soil profile,
      including exposing the profile to a depth of 30 cm at nine locations with
      differing microhabitat (e.g. bare ground, dense litter, sparse vegetation
      cover, dense vegetation cover) within the plot (Figure 1), capturing a
      photographic record of profile, capturing a photographic record of
      microhabitats sampled, identifying the soil horizons, recording if the
      horizons are atypical relative to the 1 m+ soil pit characterization (and
      noting the differences), collecting soil samples at 0–10, 10–20, and 20–30
      cm increments, taking care not to sample across horizons, and post-field
      survey processing and storage of soil samples. Five soil characterization
      sub-sites are located within a 25 x 25 m soil sub-site zone in the
      southwest corner of the plot (Figure 1) for consistency with various
      national soil research programs and monitoring protocols.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Soil bulk density</strong> – The Soil bulk density protocol covers
      the procedures and guidelines for collecting soil core samples at 0–10,
      10–20, and 20–30 cm increments from the edge of the soil pit (Figure 1),
      plus additional locations if required, sealing the core samples, and
      post-field survey processing of soil core samples. Soil bulk density
      measures are collected so that important soil parameters can be
      quantified, particularly carbon content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Soil condition samples</strong> – The Soil condition samples
      protocol covers the procedures and guidelines for the rapid, systematic
      collection of soil samples for downstream soil chemistry and bulk density
      analysis, including taking soil core samples from 10 cm increments to a
      depth of 30 cm at 10 locations (Figure 2), located within a 25 x 25 m soil
      sub-site zone in the southwest corner of the plot (Figure 1), storing the
      soil cores in individual sample bags, and post-field survey processing and
      storage of soil samples. This protocol has been designed for conservation
      practitioners to quickly obtain a representative sample of the upper soil
      profile for downstream soil chemistry analysis (e.g., soil acidity, soil
      organic carbon).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Soil metagenomics</strong> – The Soil metagenomics protocol covers
      the procedures and guidelines for the collection of soil surface samples
      for downstream soil genomics analysis, including the collection nine soil
      surface samples to 3 cm in differing microhabitats (collected immediately
      before the Soil sub-site characterization protocol samples are collected),
      or microhabitat of a target species, taxa, or group, within the plot
      (Figure 1), capturing a photographic record of microhabitats sampled, and
      post-field survey processing and storage of soil samples. Researchers and
      practitioners are strongly encouraged to undertake this protocol, if
      possible, as the samples collected provide a range of potential future
      applications for very little investment of time and resources.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The Soils module is linked to the following modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Plot description – Both modules include a description of plot slope,
      landform element and pattern, and disturbance (i.e., grazing, clearing,
      land use). If both modules are undertaken during a survey, the data from
      whichever module has been completed first will be prefilled in the module
      that is undertaken afterwards.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Cover – Substrate type and vegetation cover data provides insight into the
      microhabitats within the plot to target for sub-site and metagenomics soil
      samples.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Interventions – Conservation practitioners may undertake soil monitoring
      to monitor the success of interventions to improve soil quality (e.g.,
      slow or reverse rates of soil acidification, increase soil organic
      carbon).
