<h2 id="field-collection-3">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites-3">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before commencing the survey, the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout Module</a> must be completed.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> must be completed before or during or
the protocol. The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> is best completed by personnel
familiar with describing the landforms and vegetation
communities.</p></li>
<li><p>The protocol involves the collection and transportation of soil
samples, requiring appropriate scientific permits and approvals.
Movement of soil samples may involve obtaining a biosecurity permit,
which can entail safe packaging, proper labelling, and documentation.
Check with the local authority for specific requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-3">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and
experience of personnel, their familiarity with the landform features
and soils of the project area, soil type and depth. As a general
guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 15 minutes to collect and record soil site
observations.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow between 2 - 3 hours for digging of the soil pit.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow between 2 - 3 hours to describe soil profile, collect
samples, and record the information.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-3">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Completing the Soil site observation and pit characterisation
protocol is best conducted with two personnel. Initially, one surveyor
can be collecting soil site observation data directly into the app while
the other surveyor commences digging of the soil pit. Digging of the
soil pit, particularly where soils are deep or difficult to dig, should
be shared between personnel. Once the soil pit has been completed, one
surveyor can be describing the soil profile and collecting samples as
the other records the data directly into the app. </p></li>
<li><p>Soil site observation and soil characterisation should be
conducted by a pedologist, soil scientist, or experienced soil
surveyor. </p></li>
<li><p>Personnel should be familiar with landform, land surface and soil
attributes including but not limited to landform patterns and elements,
lithology, microrelief, erosion, drainage, soil surface conditions,
horizons features, field soil texture, soil classification. </p></li>
<li><p>Personnel should be familiar with or can familiarise themselves
with key features in the project area that will assist in an
understanding and interpretation of land surfaces and soil
characterisation in the area, including the topography, geology and
geomorphology, and any previous soil mapping conducting within or in
proximity to the area.</p></li>

    <h3 id="additional-guidelines-3">Additional guidelines</h3>
<p>The following points are adapted from NCST (2009) and McKenzie <em>et
al.</em> (2008).</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="measuring-slope">Measuring slope</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>If a clinometer is not available slope can also be measured with
a compass (some compasses are also fitted with a clinometer) or a
suitable app (such as Simple Inclinometer, Inclinometer).</p></li>
<li><p>With the clinometer, stand so you are facing directly up or down
the slope. If there is no slope, then the measurement is 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep both eyes open and align the clinometer cross hairs with the
target point in the distance. To minimise the influence of micro-relief
on the slope reading, the slope measurement should be taken across a
distance of at least 20 m.</p></li>
<li><p>The clinometer should be angled so that a consistent height above
the ground is maintained (i.e. measure eye level of another field member
standing at least 20 m away or an object that is approximately the same
height above the ground as eye level).</p></li>
<li><p>Two scales appear through the clinometer lens (degrees and
percent). Record the slope as a percent in the Monitor app.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="soil-pit-characterisation">Soil pit
characterisation</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Soil pit characterisation should be completed as close as
possible to the southwest corner of the plot (i.e. outside and
immediately adjacent to the plot; see <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>). If the soil at the
southwest corner of the plot is not representative of the soil of the
plot, consider moving to a more suitable location, ensuring it does not
in any disturbance in the plot or to other survey efforts being
undertaken.</p></li>
<li><p>Refer to the Yellow Book for further descriptions and
instructions for assessing each soil properties (NCST 2009).</p></li>
<li><p>The preferred soil characterisation method is by digging a 1 m+
soil pit. The advantages of this approach include easy observation of
vertical and lateral variation, compacting specimens is avoided, easy
sampling of undisturbed horizons with little or no contamination, and
easy to photograph exposures.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the alignment of the pit as this is important for good
photographs of the pit face. Natural sunlight can produce sharp
contrasts of shade and light that obscure subtle variation in the
profile, though full sunlight without shadows can be satisfactory. Light
cloudy conditions offer uniform lighting, which might be best. Orientate
the pit so that the face to be photographed will be illuminated by the
sun at the time (facing between northeast and northwest).</p></li>
<li><p>The pit should be large enough for comfortable working at the
face. Depending on final depth, one or more steps (about 0.3 m tread
with 0.3 m risers) should be left (see <a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>). Pits deeper than 1.5 m
require bracing to meet occupational health and safety
requirements.</p></li>
<br><img alt="Figure2" id="figure-2" height="500" src="https://w3id.org/tern/static/dawe-rlp/latest/soil/image005.jpeg" width="700"/>
<p><span class="anchor" id="_Ref139014833"></span>Figure 2. An idealised example of a manually dug soil pit</p></br>
<ul>
<li><p>During excavation, protect the soil surface above the face to be
described and sampled by laying a piece of heavy canvas or plastic sheet
at that end of the pit. Place it to one side when you begin to collect
specimens and use it to receive individual specimens as they are
removed.</p></li>
<li><p>The face of the soil profile should be picked back to expose the
natural ped faces where present. A non-reflective black or coloured tape
with clear depth markings should always be used. Soil profiles are best
photographed when moist, so they match morphological descriptions, spray
water on dry profiles from a bottle.</p></li>
<li><p>Photographing the soil pit should ideally be done with a
high-resolution camera, utilising an external camera if the device’s
camera is of low quality. In addition to the soil pit photo, consider
taking multiple images to capture key features and soil surface. As part
of the data curation, when back from the field, the images captured from
an external camera can be uploaded through the Monitor app to link with
the soil pit ID. See the Submitting EMSA Digital Media information sheet
for details.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect samples by progressive excavation of a vertical
rectangular section, sub-sectioned by depth intervals or soil horizons
or both. To obtain sufficient specimens from thin layers, it may be
necessary to collect from a larger cross-sectional area than for the
rest of the profile. Conversely, this may result in too large a specimen
if depth intervals are increased deeper in the profile. Do not solve
this problem by reducing the cross-sectional area of the section. To
avoid bias, the soil profile should be excavated to a uniform
cross-section.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid contamination by incomplete removal of overlying material
or by failure of side or back walls of the lengthening collection
channel. In most cases, it is best to start from the base of the profile
to minimise contamination.</p></li>
<li><p>Every effort should be made to dig a 1 m+ soil pit. However, if
an impenetrable layer is hit (due to rock, hardpan, water, etc.),
collect soil samples down to the depth achieved.</p></li>
<li><p>If digging a 1 m+ soil pit cannot be undertaken, other options
include:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Using a core tube or hand auger to collect soils and laying out
the profile, or</p></li>
<li><p>Using a hand auger and collecting a 500 g sample from 10 cm
increments down the profile to 1 m+.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If you need to sample or observe the soil below the bottom of the
pit, you can do so with a hand auger.</p></li>
<li><p>If conducting more than one protocol in the Soils Module, for
efficiency, one field surveyor can dig the pit while another locates and
begins digging the soil sub-pits in different microhabitats.</p></li>
<li><p>Sampling from existing exposures (e.g. road cuts, gully banks) is
undesirable because the topsoil is often disturbed, absent, or overlaid
with other material, and it is difficult to determine how representative
the exposures are.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="horizons">Horizons</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>A soil horizon is a layer of soil approximately parallel to the
land surface, with morphological properties different from layers below
and/or above it.</p></li>
<li><p>Horizons may be difficult to name but should be named in the
field. Opinions formed at the time of description are useful for later
reference.</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding horizon notation, the long-established usage in horizon
designation is adopted. Emphasis is on factual objective notation rather
than assumed genesis, as genetic implications are often uncertain and
difficult to establish.</p></li>
<li><p>Horizon codes and detailed description are listed in the soil
profile section of the Yellow Book (NCST 2009).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="soil-colour">Soil colour</h4>
<ul> 
<li><p>Soil colour is not covered in
    depth in the Yellow Book. See the Munsell Soil Color Book (Munsell Color
    2009) for further details.</p></li>
<img alt="Figure. 3" id="figure-3" height="300" src="https://w3id.org/tern/static/dawe-rlp/latest/soil/Fig3_soil_colour.jpg" width="400"/>
</ul>
<p><span class="anchor" id="_Toc140667296"></span>Figure 3. Surveyor
identifying soil colour using the Munsell Soil Color Chart</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Munsell Soil Color Charts are arranged by hue, value and chroma.
The hue notation of a colour indicates its relation to red, yellow,
green, blue and purple; the value notation indicates its lightness; and
the chroma notation indicates its strength (or departure from a neutral
of the same lightness).</p></li>
<li><p>The colours are displayed on individual soil colour charts are of
constant hue, designated by a symbol in the upper right-hand corner of
the chart.</p></li>
<li><p>Vertically, as the colours become successively lighter from the
bottom to the top of the chart by visually equal steps, their value
increases.</p></li>
<li><p>Horizontally, the colours increase in chroma to the right of the
chart and become greyer to the left.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="soil-samples-1">Soil samples</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Soils samples are collected from 10 cm increments down the entire
soil pit to a depth of 1 m+. and associated with the horizon. Avoid
sampling across horizon boundaries, apart from the standard interval of
0 – 0.1 m, where the A1 is generally much less than 0.1m thick.</p></li>
<li><p>When placing each soil sample into the applicable labelled
zip-lock bags, take care to minimise disruption to any peds or
aggregates. Coarse fragment components should be minimised in sample to
avoid overfilling the bags. If necessary, samples can be sieved in the
field using a 2 mm sieve.</p></li>

<li><p>Measure, with calipers, the internal dimensions (diameter =
L<sub>1</sub>; length = L<sub>2</sub>) of a coring ring in metres to
determine the volume (V<sub>1</sub>). Each dimension should be measured
several times</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the soil level of each intact core is trimmed level with
the ends of the coring ring. Trim using a sharp knife if
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Weigh a dry, oven proof container (e.g. an aluminium dish) with a
laboratory balance with accuracy to ±0.01 g (10 mg; weight
W<sub>1</sub>) for each core.</p></li>
<li><p>Take each core and push all of the soil out of the coring ring
into an oven-proof container. Carefully clean all soil out of each
coring ring. Weigh each container and soil (W<sub>2</sub>).</p></li>
<li><p>Dry the soil in the containers in a well ventilated oven at 105°C
until the weight is constant (approximately 48 hours).</p></li>
<li><p>Cool in a desiccator before weighing each container and oven-dry

</ol>
<p>Bulk density samples containing coarse fragments:</p>
<p>The presence of coarse fragments (i.e. particles &gt;2mm diameter) in
soil has a significant effect on bulk density. If the sample contains
coarse fragments, the mass and volume of coarse fragments, gross bulk
density of the soil with coarse fragments, and bulk density of the
fine-earth fraction (i.e. bulk density of soil without the coarse
fragment component) need to be considered (McKenzie <em>et al.</em>
2002).</p>

<li><p>After drying and cooling (see above), separate the coarse
fragment component of each sample by sieving through a 2 mm
