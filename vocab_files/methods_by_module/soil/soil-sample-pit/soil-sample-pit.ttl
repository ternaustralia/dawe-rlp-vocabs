<h2 id="field-collection-2">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites-2">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before commencing the survey, the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout Module</a> must be completed.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> must be completed before, during or
after the protocol. The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> is best completed by
personnel familiar with describing the landforms and vegetation
communities.</p></li>
<li><p>The protocol involves the collection and transportation of soil
samples, requiring appropriate scientific permits and approvals.
Movement of soil samples may involve obtaining a biosecurity permit,
which can entail safe packaging, proper labelling, and documentation.
Check with the local authority for specific requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-2">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and
experience of the personnel, the soil type and depth. As a general
guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow between 2 - 3 hours for digging of the soil pit.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow between 1 - 2 hours to collect soil samples and record the
information.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-2">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Completing the <em>Soil sample pit protocol</em> is best
conducted with two personnel, to assist with digging of the soil pit.
Once the soil pit has been completed, one surveyor can sample the pit
and the other records the data directly into the app.  </p></li>
<li><p>The surveyors should be familiar with excavating a soil pit, soil
characteristics and procedures for collecting soil samples. If surveyors
are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising, using
instruction manuals, and seeking advice before conducting this
protocol. </p></li>

   <h3 id="additional-guidelines-2">Additional guidelines</h3>
<p>The following points are adapted from NCST (2009) and McKenzie <em>et
al.</em> (2008).</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="soil-pit">Soil pit</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Soil pit should be completed as close as possible to the
southwest corner of the plot (i.e. outside and immediately adjacent to
the plot; see <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>), but should not result in any disturbance in the
plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Refer to the Yellow Book for further descriptions and
instructions for assessing each soil properties (NCST 2009).</p></li>
<li><p>The preferred soil pit sampling method is by digging a 1 m+ soil
pit. The advantages of this approach include easy observation of
vertical and lateral variation, compacting specimens is avoided, easy
sampling of undisturbed horizons with little or no contamination, and
easy to photograph exposures.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the alignment of the pit as this is important for good
photographs of the pit face. Natural sunlight can produce sharp
contrasts of shade and light that obscure subtle variation in the
profile, though full sunlight without shadows can be satisfactory. Light
cloudy conditions offer uniform lighting, which might be best. Orientate
the pit so that the face to be photographed will be illuminated by the
sun at the time (facing between northeast and northwest).</p></li>
<li><p>The pit should be large
enough for comfortable working at the face. Depending on final depth,
one or more steps (about 0.3 m tread with 0.3 m risers) should be left
(<a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>). Pits deeper than 1.5 m require bracing to meet occupational
health and safety requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<br><img alt="Figure2" id="figure-2" height="500" src="https://w3id.org/tern/static/dawe-rlp/latest/soil/image005.jpeg" width="700"/>
<p><span class="anchor" id="_Ref139014833"></span>Figure 2. An idealised example of a manually dug soil pit</p></br>
<ul>
<li><p>During excavation, protect the soil surface above the face to be
sampled by laying a piece of heavy canvas or plastic sheet at that end
of the pit. Place it to one side when you begin to collect specimens and
use it to receive individual specimens as they are removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Before photographing, the face of the soil profile should be
picked back to expose the natural ped faces where present. A
non-reflective black or coloured tape with clear depth markings should
always be used. Soil profiles are best photographed when moist, so they
match morphological descriptions – spray water on dry profiles from a
bottle.</p></li>
<li><p>Photographing the soil pit should ideally be done with a
high-resolution camera, utilising an external camera if the device’s
camera is of low quality. In addition to the soil pit photo, consider
taking multiple images to capture key features and soil surface. As part
of the data curation, when back from the field, the images captured from
an external camera can be uploaded through the Monitor app to link with
the soil pit ID. See the Submitting EMSA Digital Media information sheet
for details.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect samples by progressive excavation of a vertical
rectangular section, sub-sectioned by depth intervals or soil horizons
or both. To avoid bias, the soil profile should be excavated to a
uniform cross-section.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid contamination by incomplete removal of overlying material
or by failure of side or back walls of the lengthening collection
channel. In most cases, it is best to start from the base of the profile
to minimise contamination.</p></li>
<li><p>Every effort should be made to dig a 1 m+ soil pit. However, if
an impenetrable layer is hit (due to rock, hardpan, water, etc.),
collect soil samples down to the depth achieved.</p></li>
<li><p>If digging a 1 m+ soil pit cannot be undertaken, an alternative
is to use a hand auger and collect a 500 g sample from 10 cm increments
down the profile to 1 m+.</p></li>
<li><p>If you need to sample or observe the soil below the bottom of the
pit, you can do so with a hand auger.</p></li>
<li><p>If conducting more than one protocol from the Soils Module, for
efficiency, one field surveyor can dig the pit while another locates and
begins digging the soil sub-pits in different microhabitats.</p></li>
<li><p>Sampling from existing exposures (e.g. road cuts, gully banks) is
undesirable because the topsoil is often disturbed, absent, or overlaid
with other material, and it is difficult to determine how representative
the exposures are.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="soil-samples">Soil samples</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Soils samples are collected from 10 cm increments down the entire
soil pit to a depth of 1 m+. Although this may lead to sampling across
soil horizons, this approach has been adopted as it provides continuous
samples, which can help resolve any contention to the characterisation
of the upper soil profile.</p></li>
<li><p>When placing each soil sample into the applicable labelled
zip-lock bags, take care to minimise disruption to any peds or
aggregates. Coarse fragment components should be minimised in samples to
avoid overfilling the bags. If necessary, samples can be sieved in the
field using a 2 mm sieve.</p></li>
