<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before commencing the survey, the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Layout and Selection
Module</a> must be completed.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> must be completed before, during or
after the protocol. The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> is best completed by
personnel familiar with describing the landforms and vegetation
communities.</p></li>
<li><p>The protocol involves the collection and transportation of soil
samples, requiring appropriate scientific permits and approvals.
Movement of soil samples may involve obtaining a biosecurity permit,
which can entail safe packaging, proper labelling, and documentation.
Check with the local authority for specific requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-1">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and
experience of personnel, soil type and soil depth. As a general
guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 15 minutes to collect metagenomic sample and record the
information.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow between 30 minutes to 1 hour to dig soil sub-pit, collect
soil samples and record the information.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-1">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Completing the Soil sub-pit and metagenomics protocol and
recording the data directly into the app can be conducted by a single
surveyor. </p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor should be familiar with identifying different
microhabitats, procedures for collecting soil samples, hygiene
requirements, and the safe handling of silica granules. If surveyors are
not confident, time should be dedicated to practising, using instruction
manuals, and seeking advice before conducting this protocol. </p></li>

<p>The following points are adapted from NCST (2009) and McKenzie <em>et
al.</em> (2008).</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="combining-metagenomics-and-soil-sub-pit-sampling-1">Combining
metagenomics and soil sub-pit sampling</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>If undertaking metagenomics in conjunction with the soil sub-pit,
the metagenomics sample should be collected next to the soil sub-pit
location, immediately before the soil sub-pit is dug and sampled. This
is to ensure as little disturbance and contamination to the metagenomics
sample as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>The metagenomics sample should not be taken from the same
location as the soil sub-pit first increment (0.00 – 0.10 m) sample is
taken, to avoid removing the soil that should be captured within this
sample.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid too much activity around the soil sub-pit location before
taking the metagenomics sample to reduce potential
contamination.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Locating sub-pits</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The soil sub-pit should be located as close as possible to the
southwest corner of the plot (i.e. outside and immediately adjacent to
the plot, see Figure 1), but should not result in any disturbance in the
plot.</p></li>
<li><p>If the soil sub-pit is positioned relative to a tree or shrub,
the distance from the tree trunk or stem should be recorded in the
comments.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="soil-sub-pit-1">Soil sub-pit</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The preferred soil sub-pit sampling method is by digging 30 cm
soil pit. The advantages of this approach include easy observation of
vertical and lateral variation, compacting specimens is avoided, easy
sampling of undisturbed horizons with little or no contamination, and
easy to photograph exposures.</p></li>
<li><p>Sampling from existing exposures (e.g. road cuts, gully banks) is
undesirable because the topsoil is often disturbed, absent, or overlaid
with other material, and it is difficult to determine how representative
the exposures are.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the alignment of the sub-pit as this is important for
good photographs of the pit face. Natural sunlight can produce sharp
contrasts of shade and light that obscure subtle variation in the
profile, though full sunlight without shadows can be satisfactory. Light
cloudy conditions offer uniform lighting, which might be best. Orient
the pit so that the face to be photographed will be illuminated by the
sun at the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Before photographing, the face of the soil profile should be
picked back to expose the natural ped faces where present. A
non-reflective black or coloured tape with clear depth markings should
always be used.</p></li>
<li><p>If utilising an external camera to capture soil surface and soil
pit images, see the Submitting EMSA Digital Media information sheet for
details on linking the images to the soil pit ID through the Monitor app
when back from the field.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect samples by progressive excavation of a vertical
rectangular section, sub-sectioned by depth intervals. To avoid bias,
the soil profile should be excavated to a uniform
cross-section.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid contamination by incomplete removal of overlying material
or by failure of side or back walls of the lengthening collection
channel. In most cases, it is best to start from the base of the profile
to minimise contamination.</p></li>
<li><p>When collecting each soil sample, coarse fragment components
should be minimised in the sample to avoid unnecessary weight. Samples
can be sieved in the field using a 2 mm sieve. Sieving the sample may be
difficult when soil is moist, if this is the case, you may need to
include more sample in the bag to ensure 500 g of soil is
collected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="metagenomic-sample-collection-hygiene-1">Metagenomic sample
collection hygiene</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Calico bags should be washed in household unscented bleach (10%
bleach by volume), rinsed in distilled/boiled water and stored in an
airtight clean container prior to survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection trowel or small shovel</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Have a separate trowel ready for each plot prior to
survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Brush off any dirt or dust.</p></li>
<li><p>Wear gloves and wash trowels in household unscented bleach (10%
bleach by volume) for around 10 seconds each.</p></li>
<li><p>Rinse trowels well in distilled/boiled water to get rid of all
bleach. For rapid drying, if required out in the field, rinse trowels
with spray bottle containing methylated spirits.</p></li>
<li><p>Air dry trowels away from contaminants.</p></li>
<li><p>Bag trowels in a sterile plastic bag labelled ‘clean’ once the
above procedure is done.</p></li>
<li><p>Bag trowels in bag labelled ‘dirty’ once used.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Change disposable gloves between metagenomic sites to decrease
contamination between sites and from the personnel collecting
samples.</p></li>
<li><p>When dispensing silica beads, use a clean scoop (see collection
trowel procedure) and disposable gloves.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="mixed-silica-granules-1">Mixed silica
granules</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Read <a href="https://www.silicageldirect.com.au/content/SilicaGelBluefinal.pdf">material
safety data sheet</a> before handling silica.</p></li>
<li><p>When working with silica gel granules, ensure you work in a
well-ventilated area and wear a respirator mask and disposable
gloves.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefill 1 zip lock bag per plot with ½ a cup of mixed silica
granules prior to the survey. Prepare a safe, well-ventilated working
area and use the required PPE.</p></li>
<li><p>More mixed silica granules than ½ a cup per zip lock bag may be
required for damp samples.</p></li>
<li><p>Silica will need to be checked regularly, when the
self-indicating silica gel granules change colour from blue to pink, or
orange to green, their moisture absorbing capacity has been reached and
the mix should be replaced with fresh silica gel granules. Do not
discard the used silica gel granules as they can be oven-dried and
reused. and changed until the self-indicating granules retain their
original colour, see <a href="#sample-curation">Sample curation</a>
below for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>Store spare silica away from food or beverages in tightly closed
containers in a cool, dry and well-ventilated area.</p></li>
