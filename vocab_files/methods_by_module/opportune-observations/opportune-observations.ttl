    <h1 id="module-overview">Module overview</h1>
<p>This module covers the procedures and guidelines for recording
opportune observations of flora (vascular and non-vascular) and fauna
(vertebrate and invertebrate). Fauna observations include sightings and
calls as well as indirect evidence of species presence such as tracks
and scats.</p>
<p>Opportune observations are unplanned (no defined survey effort) and
made while undertaking other activities, at any stage of a project.
Opportune observations often occur while travelling between monitoring
plots and while undertaking other EMSA (Environmental Monitoring Systems
Australia) modules. The likelihood of species detection is increased by
traversing the project area on foot and visiting the range of habitats
present.</p>
<p>Opportune observations are entered directly into the Monitor app.
Minimum data requirements apply to save a record, including taxonomic
name or descriptive field name, location, date and time of the
observation, number of individuals observed, the observation method and
the observer. Additional information can be recorded using the optional
advanced data fields. Records can be accompanied by physical voucher
specimens and/or photo, video and audio files, to verify species
identification. Voucher specimens are linked to a record via a unique
barcode which is scanned within the app.</p>

   <h2 id="additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</h2>
<h3 id="field-collection-1">Field collection</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="general-1">General</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Opportune observations can be recorded at any time and location
within a project area, including within monitoring plots.</p></li>
<li><p>If uncertainty exists in the taxonomic identification, switch the
confident toggle to off. If the genus is unknown at the time of the
survey and there is no evidence to accompany the record, there is
generally no benefit in recording the observation.</p></li>
<li><p>If the taxonomic identification is unknown when the observation
is recorded, or if a lower taxonomic identification is possible with
accompanying evidence (e.g. high-quality photos, physical voucher
specimens), the record is given a descriptive field name and the
confident toggle is off, acting as a flag to review the record. After
reviewing the accompanying evidence, the identification can be edited in
the Monitor app and the confident toggle switched on.</p></li>
<li><p>When assigning a descriptive field name, the field name must make
sense to you as it will be used in subsequent modules for data
collection. Avoid generic labels such as Acacia sp. as this can create
confusion. Use a descriptive word (e.g. Acacia spiky). Use this name
consistently across the project area for that species.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the optional fields to record additional information. The
habitat comment field can be used to record details of the surrounding
habitat, such as the vegetation association and important habitat
features (e.g. found in a large tree hollow in Eucalyptus
viminalis).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="flora">Flora</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Only record opportune vascular flora observations within a plot
if outside of a designated monitoring event, as all flora species within
the plot are recorded during the Floristics module. This is to capture
any new flora sightings (e.g. annuals that may not have been detected
during a formal plot monitoring event).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="fauna">Fauna</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Opportune records are recommended for all vertebrate fauna
observations, however, it may prove too time-consuming to record every
observation for some species. Any sighting of a significant species
should be recorded. If some species or their signs are particularly
common, consider only recording spatially representative
samples.</p></li>
<li><p>When the species selected is Koala (<em>Phascolarctos
cinereus</em>), a <em>clinical scoring – rump</em> field will appear
under <em>advanced fields</em> for recording the condition of the
animal’s rump (see <a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="evidence-photos-video-and-audio">Evidence
(photos, video and audio)</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>It is not always possible or warranted to provide evidence of
opportune fauna observations (e.g. if observed at a distance through
binoculars, if the species is common and readily identifiable, or if the
observer is experienced). Bird observations are often visual records
only, justified by the high level of taxonomic discrimination and the
wide availability of expertise in their identification (Wildlife Ethics
Committee 2020).</p></li>
<li><p>Accompanying evidence needs to be sufficiently distinctive to
enable identification. Photos should be high resolution, show
distinguishable features, and ideally include a scale card or something
for scale (e.g. pencil). For plants, photograph an individual with good
vigour that is representative of the population recorded. Photos of the
habit of the plant and the surrounding habitat are also helpful for
identification. Refer to <a href="#appendix-4">Appendix 4</a> for plant photo voucher instructions
and guidelines.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="voucher-specimen-collection">Voucher specimen collection</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="general-2">General</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Collection of voucher specimens is not essential for opportune
observations but is considered best practice. Herbaria typically require
physical specimens for positive identification. In most cases, opportune
fauna observations will not have an associated voucher specimen given
the incidental and unobtrusive nature of the record. In the absence of a
voucher specimen, other evidence such as a photo, video, or audio file
help to validate the record.</p></li>
<li><p>Voucher specimens should only be collected if the relevant
permits and approvals have been obtained. Only collect voucher specimens
from within the project area (animal remains/signs on public roads being
an exception).</p></li>
<li><p>Seek advice from the relevant herbarium/museum regarding the
species to voucher, and the collection, preservation and labelling
requirements for voucher specimens. Accessioning of voucher specimens is
at the discretion of the herbarium/museum.</p></li>
<li><p>Before collecting a voucher specimen, consider if there are
existing specimens of the species from the area (previous records and
those recorded during other EMSA modules), the existing survey effort,
scientific knowledge gaps, representation of specimens currently held in
collections, the importance of and the quality of the specimen.</p></li>
<li><p>When there are multiple voucher specimens from the same
observation, each specimen is given a unique, sequential barcode. Take
care to ensure the correct barcode is assigned.</p></li>
<li><p>Voucher specimen details may be entered into the app after the
event (e.g. if the specimen cannot be processed at that time). If this
is the case, affix the barcode to the sample and include any additional,
sequential barcodes required (e.g. for a tissue sample) in a plastic bag
with the sample. Then, when appropriate, process the voucher and edit
the details in the Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>The voucher comment field can be used to record important
additional information, such as linked voucher records (e.g. to link the
voucher ID of a parasite to the voucher ID of its host).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="vascular-flora-voucher-specimens">Vascular
flora voucher specimens</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>For a full guide to flora vouchering (collecting, pressing,
preparing, labelling and storing specimens) refer to the Floristics
Module. Also refer to the Plant Tissue Vouchering Module for procedures
and guidelines to collect and store leaf tissue samples for DNA and
isotope analysis. Also consult with the relevant herbarium for
guidance.</p></li>
<li><p>The collection of flora voucher specimens is optional, but highly
recommended when:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>species identification is uncertain</p></li>
<li><p>a new species is recorded for the project area</p></li>
<li><p>a new species is recorded for a monitoring plot outside of a
dedicated monitoring event (e.g. annual species that were not present
during plot monitoring)</p></li>
<li><p>advised by the herbarium to address scientific knowledge gaps and
improve representation within their collection</p></li>
<li><p>it is a condition of a scientific research permit</p></li>
<li><p>a new population of a rare, threatened or endangered flora
species is found (unless collecting a specimen would jeopardise the
population)</p></li>
<li><p>a species has atypical characteristics</p></li>
<li><p>a species is recorded outside of its known range, including
introduced and weedy species</p></li>
<li><p>a species is located within a habitat in which it is unknown or
has not previously been detected</p></li>
<li><p>a species is flowering outside its typical flowering time (EPA
2016; DPIE 2020).</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If collecting a voucher specimen would jeopardise the continued
existence of a rare, threatened or endangered flora population, the
following can serve as the required voucher (listed in decreasing order
of preference):</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>A portion of the fertile plant without the root</p></li>
<li><p>Photos of the plant in conjunction with a piece of fertile plant
or plant parts (leaves and flowers or fruits)</p></li>
<li><p>Photos of fertile plant in conjunction with sterile plant
specimen</p></li>
<li><p>Sterile plant specimen only, or photos only (preferably with
descriptive notes).</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Tag each specimen securely with a unique voucher barcode label.
Place the label on stems or away from any plant parts that will need to
be examined for identification purposes. Use paper envelopes for small
specimens and attach the voucher label to the envelope.</p></li>
<li><p>Where possible, a voucher should include enough material to cover
an A3 size herbarium sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>As soon as possible. voucher specimens should be placed into a
folded sheet of newspaper and transferred into a plant press to maintain
their integrity.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="non-vascular-flora-voucher-specimens">Non-vascular flora voucher
specimens</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The collection and preparation of non-vascular flora is detailed
in Eldridge et al. (2003). A summary is provided below given
non-vascular flora is not included in other EMSA modules. Also consult
with the relevant herbarium/museum for guidance.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimise damage to colonies by only collecting small amounts as
non-vascular plants can have limited distributions and can be
slow-growing. A number of small, representative samples is generally
better than numerous random samples. For seasonally variable organisms
(e.g. fungi) collections need to be made at different times of the
year.</p></li>

<h5 class="unnumbered" id="dry-area-species">Dry-area species</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Species growing on trees and soil can be prised off with a knife
or scraper.</p></li>
<li><p>Species growing on rocks, if difficult to remove, may need to be
collected with the rock attached using a chisel and hammer.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose specimens with fruiting bodies if available to assist in
identification.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect specimens in paper bags or folded newspaper envelopes
(not plastic).</p></li>
<li><p>Include a small amount of soil for moss/liverwort/hornwort
samples to preserve rhizoids/protonema (do not press
specimens).</p></li>
<li><p>For fragile soil-borne specimens, wrap them in paper before
placing them in a paper bag.</p></li>
<li><p>Thallose liverworts/hornworts (i.e. with undifferentiated
vegetative tissue), especially when reproductive, may be placed in small
screw-cap plastic containers or cardboard boxes, to protect fragile
sporophytes.</p></li>
<li><p>Store samples in a cool, dry place.</p></li>

and difficult to identify when dry.</p></li>
<li><p>Drip-dry moist or waterlogged algae samples first to remove
excess fluid (do not squeeze).</p></li>
<li><p>Aquatic bryophyte, moss and liverwort voucher specimens can be
collected and transported in paper.</p></li>
<li><p>If algae specimens are to be kept for over 48 hours before
laboratory examination, they should be fixed with 70% alcohol
(containing 7% formalin).</p></li>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="vertebrate-fauna-voucher-specimens">Vertebrate fauna voucher
specimens</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Consult with the relevant museum for guidance on vertebrate fauna
vouchering (preparing, labelling, preserving, storing and transporting
specimens). Vertebrate vouchering is not covered in the EMSA Modules
(including the Vertebrate Fauna Module).</p></li>
<li><p>Circumstances for the opportune collection of vertebrate fauna
voucher specimens (animal remains or signs) include when:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Species identification is uncertain</p>
<p>A record is considered important (e.g. the species has a limited
occurrence, there are few existing records, the record represents a
range extension (including introduced species), the specimen has
atypical characteristics)</p>
<p>The voucher is in better condition or has more scientific value (e.g.
more likely to provide species identification) than previously collected
specimens</p>
<p>Animal remains or signs are considered important for other studies
(e.g. genetics, diet, parasites and zoonoses)</p></li>
<li><p>Advised by the relevant museum to address scientific knowledge
gaps and improve representation within their collection</p></li>
<li><p>It is a required condition of permits, approved by an animal
ethics committee</p></li>
<li><p>A dead specimen or sign is of a threatened or presumed extinct
species, no matter what the quality/condition.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Unless there are overriding circumstances, fauna voucher
specimens should only be collected if they are considered a suitable
condition for accessioning and if they can be prepared, preserved,
stored and transported appropriately. As a guide, suitable specimen
quality should be interpreted as:</p>
<p>Road kill, beach washed and freshly deceased: whole, with the skull
intact, clean (no blood stains) and not decomposing (strong odour, fur,
feathers or skin easily fall off) or desiccated.</p>
<p>Skeletal material: dry, whole and partial skeletal material may be
useful, depending on species and condition. Broken or fractured
bones/skulls are not useful.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Eggs and nests: abandoned nests or eggs are a good record of
breeding data for birds. Alternatively, a photo and measurements of the
eggs and/or nest can be used as an observational record (DPaW
2013).</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Road kills or specimens found dead or injured need to be
processed as soon as possible to maximise the usefulness of tissue
samples. If an animal has been dead for some time, tissue samples can
still be taken but record in the field notes how long you estimate it
was dead before the tissues were sampled. This will assist in
interpreting potentially anomalous results in the lab (Owens 2000).
Photos can be taken of the specimen (with scale) to accompany the
record. Ideally include close-ups showing features, any tags/microchip
numbers, etc., as well as photos of the surrounding
environment.</p></li>
<li><p>If a specimen is not required, is not of a suitable condition for
collection, or animal ethics approval has not been obtained, then take
photos (with scale) instead (DPaW 2013).</p></li>
<li><p>Tag the bag or container containing the specimen with a unique
voucher barcode label. The labelling requirements vary depending on the
type of specimen and method of preservation.</p></li>
<li><p>After labelling and scanning, place fauna voucher specimens in
airtight bags and storage containers. Storage requirements vary
depending on the type of specimen and method of preservation.</p></li>
<li><p>For preservation recommendations (where to take samples and what
to preserve them in), refer to O’Meally <em>et al.</em> (2011).</p></li>
<li><p>Recently dead animals can be a good source of ectoparasites
(fleas, mites, ticks, and lice). For ectoparasite collection
information, refer to Upton <em>et al.</em> (2010).</p></li>
<li><p>Arrange for any fresh fauna voucher specimens of significance
(e.g. road kill of a threatened species) to be transported ASAP to the
relevant museum (refer to the museum for advice).</p></li>
<li><p>Scats, sub-fossil material and skeletal remains should be put in
the freezer for a minimum of two weeks to kill any insects which may
infest museum collections (Owens 2000).</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the Monitor app and select the Opportune Module from the
projects page or via the quick-access opportune button located in the
app menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the opportune collection is not plot-based, and therefore
not associated with a plot visit, record the <em>start date time</em>
(yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss) of the opportune survey. This is only required
prior to recording the first opportune record.</p>
<p>Save the opportune survey (start) component. The first opportune
record will open. A unique sequential <em>observation ID</em> is
automatically assigned to the record.</p></li>
<li><p>Media including <em>photos, video</em> or <em>audio</em> can be
recorded for the observation. Enter a <em>comment</em> to accompany each
file (e.g. <em>close up of thorns</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>date</em>, <em>time</em> and <em>location</em> of the
observation are automatically recorded but can be changed as necessary
(i.e. if entering a record after the event). To change the location,
select <em>choose on map</em> or enter specific coordinates.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>taxa type</em> from the drop-down list. This
filters the species and other drop-down lists.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>species</em> from the drop-down list. Begin typing
the scientific or common name to query the species list. If the
identification is unknown and pending the review of evidence collected,
then manually enter a descriptive field name instead (e.g. Acacia
spiky). The field name given during this step should be used as the
field name every time that species is encountered within a survey
event.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch the <em>confident</em> toggle to <em>off</em> if the
identification is uncertain. The default is <em>on</em> (see Additional
guidelines).</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>number of individuals</em> observed (zero, blank
and no selection are invalid) and select if the number of individuals is
<em>exact</em> or an <em>estimate</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>observation method</em> (tier 1 to tier 3) from
the drop-down list (refer to Appendix 1 for the full list of
options).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>observers</em> (drop-down list, multiple
selections allowed, or manually enter first name, middle initial and
last name).</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>habitat (major vegetation group)</em> (optional)
from the drop-down list.</p></li>
<li><p>Record any <em>comments</em> (optional) (e.g. additional habitat
information, condition, fauna behaviour, presumed cause of death,
appearance, signs of disease, tag details (ID number/colour/Bluetooth
ID).</p></li>
<li><p>For flora, select the <em>growth form</em> and <em>life
stage</em> (multiple selections allowed) from the drop-down
lists.</p></li>
<li><p>For fauna, check the checkbox to record <em>additional fauna
details</em> (optional; refer to Appendix 2). Relevant fields will be
visible based on the selection of taxa type in Step 5. For direct
observations of fauna, select the <em>sex</em>, <em>age class</em> and
<em>breeding status</em> from the drop-down lists and record <em>fauna
measurements</em> (where relevant).</p></li>
<li><p>If a <em>voucher specimen</em> is collected, check the checkbox.
Assign a unique <em>voucher barcode</em> to the specimen and <em>scan
the barcode</em> (see section 3.2.2 Voucher specimen collection). Select
<em>voucher type</em> (tier 1 and tier 2) from the drop-down list (refer
to Appendix 3. for the full list of options). For vertebrate fauna
remains (i.e. carcasses), select the <em>condition of the specimen</em>
from the drop-down list. Select the <em>preservative type</em>
(drop-down list) and specify the <em>concentration</em> if relevant
(e.g. 95% undenatured ethanol). Record a <em>voucher comment</em>
(optional) (e.g. physical description of the specimen, linked voucher
IDs, prey/parasites collected with samples).</p></li>
<li><p>Add additional voucher specimens for the same observation (e.g. a
plant voucher and a plant tissue voucher) if required. Each specimen is
allocated a unique barcode.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the opportune record. Add another opportune record for the
current location if required. A new opportune record will open. The next
unique sequential <em>observation ID</em> is automatically assigned to
the record. Repeat steps 4–18.</p></li>
<li><p>After all opportune records for the current location are saved,
select the back button at the top of page to return to the project
page.</p></li>
<li><p>Record additional records by selecting the Opportune Module and
then the edit button.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of the survey, complete the opportune component and
then record the <em>end date time</em> (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss) of the
opportune survey. Check the summary of the data and queue the collection
for submission.</p></li>

   <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>This module was developed in consideration of national (Bulbert
<em>et al.</em> 2007; Jackson 2020) and state/territory survey
guidelines and protocols (Heard and Channon 1997; Owens 2000; Eldridge
<em>et al.</em> 2003; DPaW 2013; Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2015; EPA 2016;
Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2018; EPA 2020; WA Department of Biodiversity
Conservation and Attractions 2020; Centre for Invasive Species Solutions
2023), and existing platforms for recording opportune data. The work of
the National Fauna Protocols Work Group (O’Neill <em>et al.</em> 2017)
was also considered.</p>
<p>Opportune observations are important to maximise the overall species
inventory of the project area. This is particularly relevant to baseline
surveys for monitoring programs, and environmental impact assessments,
as it increases the opportunity to detect threatened and invasive
species and can help to determine the need for targeted surveys.</p>
<p>The detection of species during standardised field protocols can be
impacted by several factors, including survey method, survey timing and
location, climatic conditions, landform and habitat structure (Owens
2000). Opportune observations can help to overcome some of these
limitations and in many instances, they may represent the only record of
a species for a given area (Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>
<p>Opportune records are supplementary to standardised datasets, which
form the essential basis of statistical analysis to determine species’
status, population trends and impacts (Guillera‐Arroita 2017). Opportune
data has inherent biases and limited application for monitoring and
analysis if used alone. However, when integrated with standardised
datasets and suitable modelling techniques, opportune data can help to
improve knowledge and prediction of key population parameters, such as
species distribution, abundance and habitat suitability (e.g. van Strien
<em>et al.</em> 2013; Pagel <em>et al.</em> 2014; Maes <em>et al.</em>
2015; Giraud <em>et al.</em> 2016; Tenan <em>et al.</em> 2016; Coron
<em>et al.</em> 2018; Soroye <em>et al.</em> 2018; Henckel <em>et
al.</em> 2020). Opportune observations can also help infer responses to
environmental events such as habitat destruction and climate change and
could provide the impetus for future monitoring (Meineke <em>et al.</em>
2018).</p>
<p>Non-vascular flora and invertebrate fauna are generally
under-represented in biological surveys, partly due to a lack of
expertise in their identification (Ward and Larivière 2004). Many
species are yet to be discovered or formally described (Australian
Academy of Science 2022). Our understanding of their roles in ecosystem
function and response to environmental change is limited, however, their
application in global change research is widely recognised (Johnson and
Jones 2017; Cotton 2018; Meineke <em>et al.</em> 2018). The
vulnerability of non-vascular flora to disturbance impacts (Eldridge
<em>et al.</em> 2003) and the short life cycles and rapid response of
invertebrates to recovery measures (da Rocha <em>et al.</em> 2010;
Houghton <em>et al.</em> 2019) make them useful indicators of ecosystem
change.</p>
<p>Voucher specimens verify species identification and serve as a
definitive record of what was present and where through time.
Opportunistic voucher specimens can add significant value to
institutional collections and support research, impact assessment,
education and forensics (US National Herbarium 2002; O’Meally <em>et
al.</em> 2011; DPaW 2013; Meineke <em>et al.</em> 2018)</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
    tern:scope """
    <h1 id="introduction-and-background">Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>An opportune (or incidental) observation is a presence-only record,
collected without standardised field protocols and without an explicit
sampling design (van Strien <em>et al.</em> 2013). This module covers
the opportune observation of vascular flora (flowering plants,
gymnosperms, ferns and fern allies), non-vascular flora (algae,
bryophytes, fungi and lichens), vertebrate fauna (amphibians, birds,
mammals and reptiles) and invertebrate fauna (e.g. insects, spiders,
snails and worms). Opportune observations of fauna include sightings,
calls, and indirect evidence of species presence, such as tracks and
scats.</p>
<p>Opportune observations supplement the data collected from other EMSA
modules to provide a more complete picture of the flora and fauna
occurring within a project area. This is particularly important for
species of conservation significance, invasive species, species recorded
outside of their known distribution, species with poorly understood
habitat requirements, and small, cryptic, elusive, and sparsely
distributed species that are difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Opportune flora observations are recommended where a species is
unknown, new, threatened, invasive or important (e.g. range extension,
data deficient, contentious taxonomy, uncharacteristic growth form), and
where a species is not represented within the core monitoring plots (see
<a href="#additional-guidelines">Additional Guidelines</a>). Opportune records of flora can also be recorded
within core monitoring plots outside of a designated monitoring event
(see <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics Module</a>). Opportune flora observations may be accompanied
by voucher specimens and photos.</p>
<p>Opportune fauna observations are recommended for all fauna species
(see <a href="#additional-guidelines">Additional Guidelines</a>) and can include observations from core
monitoring plots and fauna plots, within or outside a designated
monitoring event. Opportune observations of fauna may be accompanied by
photos, video, audio and ultrasonic recordings. The Opportune Module is
not intended to cover the capture or euthanasia of vertebrate fauna;
thus, fauna voucher specimens are restricted to those collected from
deceased animals or observed signs such as scats and hair.</p>
