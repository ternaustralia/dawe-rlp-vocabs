    <h1 id="module-overview">Module Overview</h1>
<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols</h2>
<p>This module provides the procedures and guidelines to classify
vegetation at precise points across the project area. It involves
collecting rapid structural and floristic data within homogeneous
vegetation representative of the visually distinct vegetation
associations present. The data can be used to assist project area
stratification, vegetation mapping, reporting and analysis.</p>
<p>The procedures align with the national approach for collecting
vegetation mapping data outlined in the <em>Australian Vegetation
Attribute Manual: NVIS Version 7.0</em> (NVIS Technical Working Group
2017) and the <em>Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook</em>
(National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2009).</p>
<p>Vegetation mapping data can be collected at any stage of a project,
although collecting it at the start helps to stratify the project area
and inform the location of survey plots, targeted surveys and
intervention activities. Data is entered directly into the Monitor app
and is additional to any plot-derived vegetation data. This module may
be unnecessary if the project area is small (e.g. less than 5 ha) and
the range of visually distinct vegetation associations is already
represented within survey plots.</p>

<td>Emergent vegetation</td>
<td><p>The tallest plants in some vegetation communities are so sparse
that they no longer form the dominant or most significant layer. For
example, widely scattered eucalypts or acacias may rise above lower
shrubs or grasses in semi-arid regions. The tallest stratum is then
classified as an ‘emergent layer’ and the dominant layer on which the
vegetation will be classified is usually the next tallest layer.</p>
<p>For example, using the NVIS classification framework, U1 is the
tallest tree substratum. For forests and woodlands, this will generally
be the dominant stratum, except where the substratum cover is &lt;5% and
hence considered ‘emergent’. For a continuum (e.g., no distinct or
discernible layering in the vegetation) the tallest stratum becomes the
defining substratum (National Committee on Soil and Terrain in
prep).</p></td>

<p>Vegetation association (NVIS Level 5) is the recommended minimum
standard for the input of vegetation description data into NVIS. At this
level, the three predominantly recognised strata (where present), are
easily recognised for most vegetation types across Australia. For each
stratum, the characteristic height and cover are recorded, and up to 3

   <h2 id="additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</h2>
<h3 id="field-collection-1">Field collection</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="vegetation">Vegetation</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Vegetation mapping points should be in areas of homogeneous
vegetation and should cover the range of visually distinct vegetation
associations present. As a guide, for a 1:50,000 mapping scale, a
minimum of one vegetation mapping point is recommended in each visually
distinct vegetation association per every 1 km<sup>2</sup> (Gunn et al.
1988). Refer to <a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a> for sampling intensity recommendations based
on the desired mapping scale. It is recommended that vegetation mapping
points are at least 100 m apart to avoid auto-correlation.</p></li>
<li><p>If the homogeneity measure is uncertain, it is best to be
conservative and underestimate the distance to ensure
homogeneity.</p></li>
<li><p>The NVIS classification is derived from the species’ cover,
growth form and height data. Refer to <a href="#appendix-6">Appendix 6</a> for the growth forms
allowed for each stratum, height classes and cover codes.</p></li>
<li><p>Emergent plant species (with foliage projective cover &lt;5%) can
be entered. A warning message will appear when the cover value is
&lt;5%. Select OK to proceed and the species will be marked as emergent
and excluded for NVIS classification and mapping purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>If using a stand-alone digital camera to take vegetation mapping
point photos, enter the image number in the <em>photo ID</em> as a
reference so the file can be identified and curated when back in the
office (see the Submitting EMSA Digital Media information sheet for
details).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="species-identification">Species
identification</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>If the taxonomic identification is uncertain when the observation
is recorded, or if a lower taxonomic identification is possible with
accompanying evidence (e.g. high-quality photos, physical voucher
specimens), the record is given a descriptive field name. The
descriptive field name must be used consistently across modules within a
survey event. Once a descriptive field name has been entered, it will be
available in the species drop-down list across relevant modules for the
project.</p></li>
<li><p>When assigning a descriptive field name, the field name must make
sense to you. Avoid generic labels such as ‘Acacia sp.’. Use a
descriptive word instead of ‘sp.’ (e.g. Acacia spiky); this saves
confusion later regarding whether it was an uncertain species or a
species in a non-identifiable vegetative form.</p></li>
<li><p>If the taxonomic identification is known after reviewing the
accompanying evidence, edit the record, and select the species from the
drop-down list.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-2"></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>A plant photo voucher should be taken for unknown species that
have been assigned a field name to help identify them when surveying
other vegetation mapping points or completing other modules.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="taking-plant-photo-vouchers">Taking plant
photo vouchers</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Try to ensure you photograph a plant that has good vigour and is
representative of the species within the area.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a photo that shows the overall growth form of the plant (see
<a href="#appendix-7">Appendix 7</a>), as the distinctions in growth form may not be apparent to
the surveyor, but crucial to identification.</p></li>
<li><p>A suitable photographic reference scale should be used depending
on the species/features being photographed. If you do not have an actual
reference scale, use something you have on hand to provide a reference
(e.g. pen, pencil, compass).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-3"></h4>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-4"></h4>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="collecting-plant-voucher-specimens">Collecting plant voucher
specimens</h4>
<p>Refer to the Floristics Module for further information regarding the
collection and preparation of plant voucher specimens. Also, refer to
the advice provided by the local herbarium. Key information is provided
below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Collection of plant voucher specimens as part of the Vegetation
Mapping Module is optional and limited to the dominant three species
(≥5% cover) in the dominant three strata. Plant voucher specimens are
recommended for new, unknown, important, contentious and threatened
species (see definitions in the Floristics Module). Specimens of
threatened species should only be collected if permitted and if their
collection will not jeopardise the population.</p></li>
<li><p>The need to collect a voucher specimen will depend on the
circumstances and the other modules undertaken (e.g. if a species of
uncertain identification has already been assigned a field name and a
suitable voucher specimen has already been collected within the same
visit, then collecting a further voucher specimen may be
unnecessary).</p></li>
<li><p>The Opportune Module is used to record plant species of interest
observed at vegetation mapping points that are not captured by the
Vegetation Mapping Module (i.e. species of &lt;5% cover).</p></li>
<li><p>Herbaria typically require physical specimens for positive
identification. Where possible, a voucher should include enough material
to cover an A3 size herbarium sheet. For specimens that you anticipate
herbaria will wish to lodge (e.g. species of interest to the herbaria
determined from pre-survey consultation), a duplicate should be
collected.</p></li>
<li><p>To aid identification, each voucher should ideally include when
available: flowers or buds, leaves, fruit, and bark (for trees). Try to
minimise the number of individual specimens needed to represent each
species by maximising the number of plant components (e.g. flowers,
fruit, leaves) on each sample collected.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally, voucher specimens are pressed after each vegetation
mapping point, but if this is not possible, press them before commencing
another module, or at least by the end of each day’s field work. Until
pressed, place larger specimens in a plastic bag, and smaller specimens 
in paper bags within the plastic bag, and store them in an appropriate
place to maintain their quality. To avoid confusion, it is best to place
specimens from vegetation mapping points in a separate plant press to
those obtained from plots and opportune sampling.</p></li>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Classifying and mapping vegetation is critical to environmental
assessments, landscape management, and ecological research (Addicott
<em>et al.</em> 2018; Luxton <em>et al.</em> 2021; Patykowski <em>et
al.</em> 2021). Vegetation classification helps to understand the
patterns and drivers of species distributions (Addicott <em>et al.</em>
2021). Vegetation mapping underpins the assessment of biodiversity
through space and time, to support biodiversity planning and management
at various scales. Furthermore, vegetation classification and mapping
are integral to Australian biodiversity laws and regulations (Lewis
<em>et al.</em> 2008; McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008; Gellie <em>et
al.</em> 2018; Addicott <em>et al.</em> 2021).</p>
<p>The NVIS framework is the nationally adopted approach to classifying
vegetation, underpinned by rule sets and mandatory data requirements to
deliver standardised and comprehensive vegetation descriptions. The NVIS
vegetation hierarchy provides a system for describing the structural and
floristic patterns of groups of plants in the landscape and consists of
six levels of classification (Level 1 the simplest to Level 6 the most
complex). The data collected in this protocol facilitates classification
at NVIS Level 5 (vegetation association) with minimal observer bias and
enables the automatic generation of higher levels (NVIS Technical
Working Group 2017). This approach ensures the classification is
consistent and comparable within and across projects and jurisdictions
(Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2017; Baruch <em>et al.</em> 2018; Addicott
<em>et al.</em> 2021), and is suitable for inclusion in state, territory
and national vegetation datasets (Executive Steering Committee for
Australian Vegetation Information 2003; NVIS Technical Working Group
2017).</p>
<p>The vegetation mapping methodology is intentionally rapid and is more
efficient than other survey methods to define and map vegetation
associations. Locating vegetation mapping points in homogeneous areas is
the most compatible approach for vegetation mapping. By recording a
measure of homogeneity, the vegetation mapping points are effectively
virtual quadrats of variable size, in which the structural and floristic
data (and thus mapping class) is deemed to adequately describe the
vegetation association (Sparrow and Leitch 2009).</p>
<p>The collection of quantitative species-based cover data is considered
best practice for vegetation classification (Addicott <em>et al.</em>
2021). It provides the ability to measure change over time and under
different disturbance scenarios, and is robust and readily defensible,
helping to instil confidence in the classification in both legislators
and end users (Sparrow and Leitch 2009; Addicott <em>et al.</em>
2021).</p>
<p>This protocol requires visual estimates of foliage projective cover
to the nearest 1% (for species over 5% cover), however, accuracy is not
assumed nor required to this level. The quantitative data can later be
converted to a categorical value. This approach assists data reuse and
is less subjective than assigning categories at the point of collection.
Species with less than 5% cover are not considered a significant
influence on the association definition or the spectral response and
hence are excluded for efficiency (Sparrow and Leitch 2009; Patykowski
<em>et al.</em> 2021).</p>
<p>The intended use of data derived from the broad characterisation of
vegetation associations at vegetation mapping points differs from the
detailed vegetation survey undertaken at survey plots. The combined
‘hybrid’ approach optimises survey timing, increases sampling and search
intensity, enables sampling of rare and restricted vegetation
communities, and provides the opportunity for both systematic and
opportunistic collection of herbarium specimens (Bell and Driscoll 2020;
Patykowski <em>et al.</em> 2021).</p>
<p>Project-level vegetation mapping is generally based on the available
ground data, i.e. from the vegetation mapping points (this module) and
survey plots, and a visual interpretation of vegetation association
boundaries using aerial photographs or satellite imagery. Whilst this
approach is appropriate at small scales, the result can be subjective
and vary considerably between observers and projects, thus limiting the
usefulness of the data at the broader scale. Post-field numerical
analysis of the data (e.g. using hierarchical cluster analysis to
classify the vegetation data, and supervised image analysis to spatially
classify remotely sensed data based on spectral characteristics), is a
much more accurate, time-efficient and cost-effective approach at a
landscape scale (Xie et al. 2008; Sparrow and Leitch 2009; Uyeda et al.
2020).</p>
<p>The tooling and integrated database to collect NVIS-compatible
vegetation data at defined vegetation mapping points provides users with
clean, consistent, repeatable and spatially explicit data outputs to
assist with vegetation mapping and reporting. The centralised collation
of the data means it can be used to produce larger-scale, more complex
classifications and improved mapping outputs, which in turn will improve
the information available to future users. For example, project data
from across Australia could help to update NVIS classification and
mapping and help to fill gaps in the current dataset (Bell and Driscoll
2020).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>5-15 minutes per vegetation mapping point to collect the required
information.</p></li>
<li><p>10-15 minutes per vegetation mapping point to collect and prepare
voucher specimens, attach voucher labels, and scan and enter details
into the app.</p></li>
<li><p>10 minutes per plant press every 2–3 days, during and immediately
after the field survey, to inspect and change newspaper as necessary,
until specimens are dry.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements">Personnel requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Vegetation mapping can be completed by one person but is easier
with two, so one can make the observations and the other can record the
data directly into the app.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor making the observations is ideally familiar with
vegetation attributes and experienced in identifying the vegetation
within the area.</p></li>
<li><p>Scientific permits are required if voucher specimens are
collected. Additional permits may be required for collecting threatened
plant species, check with the local authority. Land access permissions
are required.</p></li>

     <h1 id="introduction-and-background">Introduction and background</h1>
<p>Vegetation mapping incorporates a classification of the vegetation,
and a spatial attribution of that classification (Tierney et al. 2017).
Classifying and mapping vegetation helps to simplify complex systems
into discreet units and understand the distribution of vegetation
communities (Addicott et al. 2018; Patykowski et al. 2021).</p>
<p>This module provides a standardised approach to vegetation
classification, in line with the nationally adopted National Vegetation
Information System (NVIS) information hierarchy (NVIS Technical Working
Group 2017). Data is collected at precise ‘vegetation mapping points’
within homogeneous vegetation, as summarised in <a href="#table-1">Table 1</a>. The vegetation
attributes enable the classification of the vegetation to NVIS Level 5
(association) (NVIS Technical Working Group 2017). The homogeneity
measure assists in vegetation classification and mapping (Sparrow et al.
2020). Additional information such as vegetation growth stage,
disturbance and fire history helps to identify variability within
vegetation associations and assist stratification and assessment (Heard
and Channon 1997; Brocklehurst et al. 2007).</p>
<p>Vegetation mapping points should cover the range of visually distinct
vegetation associations present, including common, threatened and
exotic. The number of vegetation mapping points will depend on a range
of factors, such as the survey aims, availability/accuracy of existing
mapping, size of the project area and the variability of the vegetation
(see <a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>). The greater the number of vegetation mapping points,
the more accurate the vegetation mapping will be. For example, for a map
scale of 1:50,000, at least one vegetation mapping point is recommended
in each visually distinct vegetation association per every 1
km<sup>2</sup> (Gunn et al. 1988). The vegetation mapping points should
be at least 100 m apart to avoid auto-correlation.</p>
<p>For small project areas and/or those with relatively few vegetation
associations, vegetation mapping can be extrapolated from the vegetation
mapping points and visual interpretation of aerial or satellite imagery.
At larger scales, where ground data is sporadic and there are numerous
vegetation associations to discern, the point data buffered by the
homogeneity measure enables accurate spatial correlation between the
field data and remotely sensed imagery, to create robust mapping
outputs.</p>
