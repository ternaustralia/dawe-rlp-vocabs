<li>Select a suitable location for a vegetation mapping point:
<ul>
<li>Prior to Field Survey consider. <strong>Note:</strong> it may not be necessary to undertake this module if the project area is small (e.g. &lt;5 ha) and the range of visually distinct vegetation associations are already represented within survey plots.<br />
<ul>
<li>Review existing data, available aerial/satellite imagery, NVIS/other vegetation mapping for the area of interest and surrounds. This will provide an indication of the likely extent of native vegetation cover and the vegetation types to be expected (and whether any threatened species or ecological communities have been recorded in or around the area), assist with project area level stratification for vegetation mapping/survey purposes, and help to determine the potential number of survey points required. Refer to the Plot selection and layout Module for key sources of information to review.</li>
<li>Determine if vegetation mapping is necessary and at what scale (see step 4). This will depend on the:
<ul>
<li>Scale, aims, requirements and budget of the project</li>
<li>The availability, scale and accuracy (spatial and classification) of existing mapping</li>
<li>Changes to the project area since previous vegetation survey/mapping was undertaken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Determine what needs to be mapped based on the scope of the project (i.e. all of project area or only areas to be impacted or managed).</li>
<li>Determine if a reconnaisance survey is necessary to:
<ul>
<li>Verify the accuracy of existing information</li>
<li>Confirm if a nationally threatened species/ecological community is present</li>
<li>Undertake site stratification (i.e. mud-map of visually distinct vegetation associations) based on visual interpretation</li>
<li>Refine the proposed location of plots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure you are located within homogeneous vegetation</li>
<li>Avoid shrubs or trees in the foreground when facing south, so the photo is unobscured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If using an external GNSS receiver (e.g. Trimble 1) to record location:</li>
<ul>
<li>switch on by depressing power button in centre. It will flash green and blue as it looks to connect to Bluetooth.</li>
<li>Navigate to the mobile device's Bluetooth settings and turn Bluetooth ON.</li>
<li>Check the "Devices" list and wait for the "GNSS:XXX" to appear. Select it and you should be connected.</li>
<li>Navigate to the GNSS Status App and select "Source". If the GNSS is in recent pick list, then select. If not, select "Position Source" to be the Bluetooth and select from available devices.</li>
<li>Allow some time to let the accuracy drop to sub metre.</li>
</ul>
<li>Select the Vegetation Mapping module in the App.</li>
<li>Select &lsquo;Start vegetation mapping point&rsquo;. The GPS location (as well as date, time and positional accuracy of record) will be automatically recorded The default source is the GPS inbuilt into your device, unless an alternative is selected.</li>
<li>At each vegetation mapping point, record:</li>
<ul>
<li>A field ID (optional). Note that a sequential ID will be automatically assigned; this is an additional field to assist with site stratification (VA1, VA2, VA3, etc.).</li>
<li>A &lsquo;homogeneity measure&rsquo; (in metres), defined as a record of the visual estimate of the shortest distance from the vegetation mapping point to a vegetation association different to the one that you are sampling.&rsquo;</li>
<li>A static landscape photo facing south wherever possible to minimise the effect of shadow and ensure consistent photos, using the highest resolution that your device allows (refer to the Photo points module for rationale). Select photo direction from the drop-down list (default is south).</li>
<li>Additional photos (optional). Select photo direction from the drop-down list.</li>
<li>Consider an approximate area of 10 x 10m centred around the vegetation mapping point and record the following:
<ul>
<li>Vegetation growth stage (drop-down list)</li>
<li>Disturbance (drop-down list)</li>
<li>Fire-history (drop-down list)</li>
<li>Comment (optional)</li>
<li>For all plant species with covers greater than 5%:
<ul>
<li>Species (or a field name if uncertain). Field names must be consistent between sites on the same survey.</li>
<li>Visual interpretation of foliage projective cover to the nearest 1% (e.g. Acacia aneura 36%)</li>
<li>Dominant growth form (drop-down list, auto-filtered by species selection)</li>
<li>Maximum height (m)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Photo/s (optional)</li>
<li>Substrate cover &ndash; a visual interpretation of actual percentage cover for all relevant substrates (drop-down list); e.g. Bare 14%, Litter 9%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<li>When the taxonomy of a flora species is uncertain, collect a voucher specimen to be confirmed by the relevant herbarium, taking enough material to cover an A3 size herbarium sheet (Note: Prior to collection a permit may be required &ndash; see Chapter 1 Introduction). Refer to vouchering guidelines in the Floristics module. Any species of uncertain identification is allocated a field name, which is reselected from the list if repeated at other vegetation mapping points. Note: a voucher of every species must still be taken at each survey plot, regardless of any duplication from vegetation mapping points or opportunistic records.</li>
<li>Return to the field vehicle or an area where all the equipment is available.</li>
<li>Tag each specimen securely with a unique voucher label provided by TERN. Place the label on stems or away from any plant parts that will need to be examined for identification purposes. Use paper envelopes for small specimens and attach the voucher label to the envelope.</li>
<li>For each specimen, scan the voucher label using the App. Add any relevant comments.</li>
<li>Select &lsquo;Save&rsquo; to save the species record and begin entering the next record.</li>
<li>Once all species have been entered and voucher barcodes scanned, select &lsquo;Complete Module&rsquo; to return to the &lsquo;Module Selection&rsquo; screen.</li>
<li>After labelling and scanning each specimen, place larger specimens directly into a plastic bag, and smaller specimens into paper bags, then the plastic bag, ready for transferring to a plant press. Temporarily store in an appropriate place to maintain the quality of specimens until pressed.</li>
<li>At the end of each field day, press voucher specimens of each plant species in a plant press. Keep samples in a separate press to plot samples if possible to avoid confusion.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Vegetation</p>
<ul>
<li>The mapping interface within the App will allow you to track your location and record and visualise your vegetation mapping points (which will ensure an adequate number and distribution of points) and create a new vegetation mapping data layer.</li>
<li>Existing vegetation mapping can also be loaded onto the GPS enabled mobile device as a georeferenced PDF for use in an offline mapping application (e.g. Avenza Maps). Although this approach does not allow for data collection and visualization, it will allow you to track your location relative to the mapped vegetation within the project area.</li>
<li>Click on information buttons within the App to access more information and a description about the collection fields.</li>
<li>Where there is uncertainty in estimating the homogeneity measure, be conservative in estimating the distance (it is better to underestimate to ensure homogeneity). GPS error should also be taken into consideration, particularly if the homogeneity measure is small. If working in large homogeneous areas, existing field mapping and use of the vehicle odometer may help to estimate the shortest distance to a different vegetation association to that being sampled.</li>
<li>Where it is not possible to directly observe the distance to a different association (e.g. goes over dune crest), estimate the furthest distance that you are sure is within the same association (i.e. as far as you can still see the vegetation association from the point you are standing).</li>
<li>The following growth forms are allowed for each stratum (these will be pre-filtered in the App based on species selection):</li>
<li>Upper &ndash; trees, tree mallee</li>
<li>Middle &ndash; shrubs, low trees, mallee shrubs, tall grasses, grass trees</li>
<li>Ground &ndash; grasses, forbs, rushes, sedges, lichens, low shrubs, ferns, grass trees.</li>
<li>Only species that fall into the growth forms associated with each stratum will be available in the drop-down list for that layer (e.g. only species classified as trees or tree mallees can be selected from the upper story species lists).</li>
<li>The structural formation and NVIS Level 5 classification is derived from the species&rsquo; cover, growth form and height data and will auto-generate once a vegetation mapping location record is complete. For a list of growth forms, height classes and cover codes, refer to the Vegetation Resources information provided as part of the Appendices at the end of this module or click on the info button within the App.</li>
<li>You can collect opportunistic observations (flora and fauna) while undertaking vegetation mapping.</li>
<li>See the Plant tissue vouchering module for procedures to collect leaf material from a voucher for downstream molecular analysis. Plant tissue vouchering is not necessary for this module but is an option if particular species of interest are observed.</li>
<li>If necessary, you can amend the record after clicking &lsquo;Save&rsquo; by using the &lsquo;Edit&rsquo; function.</li>
<li>If interested in recording the boundary between two vegetation associations to assist with project area stratification and vegetation mapping, this should be done in the Field notebook App feature.</li>
<li>The mapping interface will show the location of all the point samples over aerial imagery. Points can be selected, coloured and labelled based on the vegetation association so that similar vegetation associations can be classed together to assist field stratification (i.e. 1a, 1b, 1c, 2).</li>
</ul>
<p>Photos</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the highest resolution possible on your device.</li>
<li>Where possible, take the photo facing south and ensure any large trees or shrubs do not obscure the photo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Species identification</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking of voucher specimens is of vital importance. Consequently, TERN have created printed adhesive voucher labels that have a barcode on them that can be scanned by mobile device software and linked directly into the App. The voucher labels are available from DAWE/TERN. Note that a separate batch of sequential barcodes are used for each plant voucher, as well as each leaf tissue sample. Therefore, care is need to ensure the correct label is being used.</li>
<li>When entering a field name for the vouchers it is essential that the field name makes sense to you as it will be used in subsequent modules for data collection. The name can be anything, but it is essential that the name is used on every occasion that you are detailing that species; you must be consistent with its use across the project.</li>
<li>The field names will not be made publicly available when the plot data is published, however herbarium staff will have access to your field names.</li>
<li>Avoid using labels such as &lsquo;Acacia sp.&rsquo;. Use a descriptive word instead of &lsquo;sp.&rsquo; (e.g. Acacia spiky); this saves confusion later regarding whether it was a genuine species in a non-identifiable vegetative form or not.</li>
<li>Use consistent taxonomy across the jurisdictions following published names used in the Australian Plant Name Index.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting vouchers</p>
<ul>
<li>To aid identification, each voucher should ideally include when available: flowers or buds, leaf, fruit, and bark (for trees). See the Floristics module for an example. Try to minimise the number of individual specimens needed to represent each species by maximising the number of plant components (e.g. flowers, fruit, leaves) on each sample collected.</li>
<li>If available, collect young, actively growing material for plant tissue vouchering. Although it is inevitable that during some surveys only sterile or vegetative material will be available, such material should still be collected.</li>
<li>For small species, collect the whole plant, including the basal material and roots, particularly for Gramineae (Poaceae), Cyperaceae and Juncaceae. See the Floristics module for an example.</li>
<li>For small annuals and ephemerals, collect a number of individuals.</li>
<li>For wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper to assist drying-out.</li>
<li>For small wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper and place them in a small snap-lock bag or paper bag until ready for pressing.</li>
<li>As a minimum requirement, press specimens by the end of each day&rsquo;s field work. Pressing plants in the field ensures that none are lost and also speeds up the identification process as diagnostic characters will be better preserved when pressed soon after collection.</li>
<li>When pressing, use one folded tabloid sized newspaper sheet for each specimen and use corrugated cardboard dividers frequently &ndash; to a maximum of one cardboard between every fifth specimen or more frequently for bulky or wet specimens.</li>
<li>Change the newspaper regularly to prevent specimens becoming mouldy. Frequent changes will be necessary if specimens were damp when collected. Place press in a dryer as soon as possible (or at least a warm, dry place).</li>
<li>Keep succulent plants in a separate press to facilitate easier changing of papers and reduce the risk of damaging other specimens.</li>
<li>Succulent plants are difficult to dry and can be frozen overnight (either in the field or on return to the office) to fracture the cell walls enabling the moisture to escape. Once frozen, the specimen can be transferred to newspaper and cardboard in the press for the vegetation mapping point from which it was recorded.</li>
