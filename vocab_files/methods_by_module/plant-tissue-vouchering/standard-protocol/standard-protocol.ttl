<h1 id="standard-protocol">Standard protocol</h1>
<h2 id="field-collection">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites-1">Pre-requisites</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Prepare one sealable airtight container per plot with mixed
self-indicating (10%) and standard (90%) silica gel granules to a depth
of 1 cm.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare extra containers in case of additional plots and/or
diverse plots.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-1">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and
experience of personnel, their familiarity with the flora of the region,
the number of replicate samples required, and the species richness and
cover within the plot.</p>
<p>As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow between 15–45 minutes to take plant tissue vouchers from
plant specimen vouchers, place them in synthetic-fibre bags, and label,
scan and store the synthetic-fibre bags.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow approximately 10 minutes, every 2–3 days during the field
survey, to inspect and change silica gel granules if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow approximately 10 minutes, every 5–7 days after the field
survey, to inspect and change silica gel granules if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 1–2 hours after the field survey to liaise with TERN to
arrange delivery and biosecurity import permits required to send the
leaf tissue vouchers to the TERN Australia Soil and Herbarium
Collection.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-1">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Searching the plot and collecting a plant tissue voucher for the
flora species present is best conducted with two personnel. This enables
more ground, including microhabitats, to be covered, from multiple
viewpoints.</p></li>
<li><p>Processing plant tissue vouchers is best conducted with two
personnel, one processing the vouchers and one recording the data
directly into the app.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyors making the observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying the characteristic identifiable features of
flora species and how to distinguish one species from another. If
surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising,
using field reference guides, and seeking advice before conducting this
protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Plant tissue vouchering involves the collection of plant tissue
vouchers. Therefore, scientific permits are likely to be required,
particularly for collecting threatened flora species, but always check
with your local authority.</p></li>
<li><p>Plant tissue vouchering does not involve interference with
wildlife. Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals
are unlikely to be required but always check with your local authority.
Access permissions are required.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Limit DNA contaminating the plant tissue vouchers by holding
broad-leaf plants by the petiole (leaf stem), and grasses by the base of
the leaves. Hands and secateurs can be cleaned using hand sanitiser and
alcohol wipes to help limit contamination.</p></li>
<li><p>If available, collect young actively growing leaf material that
is free from damage, disease, insect or fungal contamination. If not
available, collect the best/freshest growth that is on offer.</p></li>
<li><p>Plant tissue of threatened species should not be collected if not
permitted or if it will jeopardise the individual or
population.</p></li>
<li><p>To ensure enough leaf material is available for analysis (i.e.
several grams once dried), ensure synthetic-fibre bags are full of the
leaf material, and consider collecting additional material of fleshy
tissue species (e.g. succulent plants).</p></li>
<li><p>It can be difficult to confidently identify species with variable
leaf morphology (e.g. <em>Senna artemisioides</em> ssp., <em>Acacia
aneura</em> ssp.). If there appears to be morphologically different
species in the plot, collect replicate plant tissue vouchers to confirm
their identity.</p></li>
<li><p>Replicate sample collection for population genetics analysis is
widely spaced within the plot to minimise the risk of sampling closely
related individuals. The distance to close relatives can vary between
species/growth forms and should be considered when collecting samples.
For example, distances of 2 m, 10 m and 100 m were used to avoid
sampling nearest neighbours of <em>Goodenia</em> spp. (low understorey
shrubs; Kireta <em>et al.</em> 2019), <em>Dodonaea viscosa</em> ssp.
<em>angustissima</em> (tall midstorey shrubs; Christmas <em>et al.</em>
2016), and <em>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</em> (trees; Butcher <em>et
al.</em> 2009), respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>For further information regarding the design and implementation
of population genetics studies, broad guidelines are provided in a
number of textbooks (e.g. Lowe et al. 2004; Allendorf and Luikart
2013).</p></li>
<li><p>Standardised methods to address clonality in population genetics
studies are outlined by Arnaud-Haond et al. (2007).</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally all plant tissue vouchers from the plot should fit into a
single Sistema® KLlP IT™ 2 L or 3 L rectangle container. Pack samples
carefully, whilst making use of the available space. If you line the
samples up, rather than stacking them, this will help to fit more and
makes it easier to sort through the collected samples (see <a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>).
Avoid using two containers per plot where possible.</p></li>
<li><p>If you run out of synthetic-fibre bags in the field, plant tissue
vouchers can be temporarily stored in labelled paper bags, envelopes or
within folded newspaper (i.e. from your plant press supplies; see
<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics Module</a>). Store these samples in a separate container with
silica gel granules so that they can easily be transferred to
synthetic-fibre bags following the field survey.</p></li>
<li><p>A separate batch of sequential voucher barcode labels are used
for each plant tissue voucher, as well as each flora voucher, fauna
voucher, soil sample and soil metagenomic sample collected. Therefore,
care is needed to ensure the correct label is being used.</p></li>
<li><p>When the self-indicating silica gel granules change colour from
blue to pink, or orange to green, their moisture absorbing capacity has
been reached and the mix should be replaced with fresh silica gel
granules. Do not discard the used silica gel granules as they can be
oven-dried and reused.</p></li>
<li><p>Care should be taken when working with silica gel granules as
exposure to fine silica dust can cause respiratory illness and disease.
Although the risk of generating silica dust is low, ensure you work in a
well-ventilated area and wear a respirator mask and disposable
gloves.</p></li>
<li><p>If you run out of fresh silica gel granules in remote areas, used
silica gel granules can be dried in a large pot (not used for cooking)
on a stove or over a fire. Care should be taken not to scorch the
desiccant as this can cause a loss of moisture capacity and breakdown of
the indicator. When the indicator granules have returned to their
original colour, the silica gel granules are ready to be reused (Funk
<em>et al.</em> 2017). Drying time will vary depending on moisture
content.</p></li>

<li><p>Collect at least five widely spaced replicate samples (see Key definitions and terminology) for each of the dominant perennial species of the plot (i.e.
projected foliar cover &gt;2% or canopy cover &gt;5%) or from species
targeted for population genetics studies, ensuring each sample is
collected from different areas within the plot to minimise the risk of
sampling closely related individuals. Take a mental note of the distance
between samples collected (recorded in the app in Step 9
below).</p></li>

vouchers from species with large (A) and small (B) leaves.</p>
<li><p>Return to the field vehicle or a designated area with the
equipment required to process the plant specimen and plant tissue
vouchers.</p></li>
<li><p>As you are recording and scanning each flora species voucher in
the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics Module</a> in the app, press the <em>plant tissue
voucher</em> button. This will take you to the Plant Tissue Vouchering
Module. The floristics information for each species (<em>field
name</em>, <em>floristics voucher barcode</em>, <em>growth form 1</em>
and <em>growth form 2</em>) will be displayed to ensure you link the
plant tissue voucher to the correct species.</p></li>
<li><p>For each plant tissue voucher, take enough of the fresh leaves
(or best available) to fill a synthetic-fibre bag (approximately 10
cm<sup>2</sup>; <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Seal the synthetic-fibre bag, and attach the voucher barcode
label so it lays flat across the front and is scannable (see <a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Scan the <em>voucher barcode</em> into the app by pressing the
<em>record voucher barcode</em> button.</p></li>
<li><p>If replicates for the species have been collected, record the
<em>replicate number</em> and the <em>minimum distance between
replicates</em> in metres (should be the same for each replicate).
Ensure that replicates are processed successively and labelled with
successive voucher barcode labels.</p></li>
<li><p>Press the <em>save</em> button to save the record and return to
the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics Module</a> screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the synthetic-fibre bag in the container with 1 cm of mixed
silica gel granules (<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 5–11 for all new, dominant perennial, unknown,
important, contentious and threatened species plant specimen/tissue
vouchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the lid securely on the container and label the container
(not the lid) with the <em>plot code</em>, <em>date</em> and
<em>container number</em> (e.g. 1/2, 2/2; see <a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>), as a minimum,
using a blank adhesive label or masking tape and a permanent
marker.</p></li>
<li><p>Store the containers in a cool location out of direct
light.</p></li>
<li><p>Throughout the field survey check on the containers and replace
silica gel granules when necessary.</p></li>
