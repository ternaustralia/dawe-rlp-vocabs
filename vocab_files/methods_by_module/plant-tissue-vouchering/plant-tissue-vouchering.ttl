<li>Collect a representative sample of each flora species present within the plot following the procedures and guidelines in the Floristics module. Ensure that each sample is big enough, or collect an additional specimen so that approximately 10 cm2 can used as a plant tissue voucher without comprimising the herbarium voucher specimen (see Additional guidelines below).</li>
<li>Collect at least five widely spaced replicate samples for each of the dominant perennial species of the plot (i.e. projected foliar cover &gt;2% or canopy cover &gt;5%) or from species targeted for population genetics studies, ensuring each sample is collected from different areas within the plot to minimise the risk of sampling closely related individuals. When collecting the replicates, take a mental note of the distance between samples collected (recorded in the app in step 9 below).</li>
<li>Return to the field vehicle or an area where all the equipment is available.</li>
<li>As you are recording and scanning each flora species voucher in the Floristics module in the App, press the ‘Collect plant tissue voucher’ button. This will take you to the Plant tissue vouchering module (Figure 2). The flora species identification/assigned field name and growth form will be automatically populated from the Floristics module. Pick another growth form from the drop-down list if necessary.

</li>
<li>Seal the synthetic-fibre bag, and place the QR code label on the tea bag, ensuring the QR code itself lays flat across the front of the tea bag and does not wrap around the teabag which makes it unreadable by the QR code scanning software (see Figure 1).</li>
<li>Scan the QR code using the App to link the teabag label to the plot and the herbarium voucher specimen.</li>
<li>The ‘Replicate number’ will automatically be ‘1’. If not collecting replicate samples, leave this and go to step 11.</li>
<li>Record the ‘Minimum distance between replicate samples’ in metres.</li>
<li>Press the ‘Add replicate sample’ button and repeat steps 5–9 for each replicate sample. The ‘Replicate number’ field will automatically update for each additional replicate (2, 3, 4, 5, etc.). The ‘Minimum distance between replicate samples’ will automatically populate based on the distance recorded for the first replicate. Ensure that replicates are processed successively and labelled with successive QR code labels.</li>
<li>Press the ‘Save’ button to save the record and return to the Florisitics module screen.</li>
<li>Place the synthetic-fibre bag/s in the container with 1 cm of mixed silica gel granules (Figure 4).</li>
<li>Repeat for all herbarium voucher specimens.</li>
<li>Place the lid securely on the container, and label the container (not the lid) with the plot code using a blank adhesive label or masking tape and a permanent marker. If a second container is required, label the container (not the lid) with the plot code and ensure the containers are numbered (i.e. 1/2, 2/2; see Figure 4).</li>
<li>Store the containers in a cool location out of direct light.</li>
<li>Throughout the field survey check on the containers and replace silica gel granules when necessary (see Additional guidelines below).

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limit contaminating the plant tissue samples by holding broad-leaf plants by the petiole (leaf stem), and grasses by the base of the leaves. Hands and secateurs can be cleaned using hand sanitiser and alcohol wipes to help limit contamination.</li>
<li>If available, collect young actively growing leaf material that is free from damage, disease, insect or fungal contamination. If not available, collect the best/freshest growth that is on offer.</li>
<li>To ensure enough leaf material is available for analysis (i.e. several grams once dried), ensure tea bags are full of the specimen material, and consider collecting additional material of fleshy tissue species (e.g. succulent plants).</li>
<li>It can be difficult to confidently identify species with variable leaf morphology (e.g. Senna artemisioides ssp., Acacia aneura ssp.). If there appears to be morphologically different species in the plot, collect replicate plant tissue samples to confirm their identity.</li>
<li>Ideally all specimens from the plot should fit into a single Sistema® KLlP IT™ 2 L or 3 L rectangle container. Pack specimens carefully, whilst making use of the available space. If you line the specimens up, rather than stacking them, this will help to fit more and makes it easier to sort through the collected specimens (see Figure 4). Avoid using two containers per plot where possible.</li>
<li>If you run out of synthetic-fibre bags in the field, plant tissue samples can be temporarily stored in labelled paper bags, envelopes or within folder newspaper (i.e. from your plant press supplies; see Floristics module). Store these samples in a separate container with silica gel granules so that they can easily be transferred to synthetic-fibre bags following the field survey.</li>
<li>A separate batch of sequential QR code/barcode voucher labels are used for each plant tissue voucher, as well as each flora voucher, fauna voucher, soil sample and soil metagenomic sample collected. Therefore, care is needed to ensure the correct label is being used.</li>
<li>When the self-indicating silica gel granules change colour from blue to pink, or orange to green, their moisture absorbing capacity has been reached and the mix should be replaced with fresh silica gel granules. Do not discard the used silica gel granules as it can be oven-dried and reused. Drying time in the oven will vary depending on moisture content.</li>
<li>Care should be taken when working with silica gel granules as exposure to fine silica dust can cause respiratory illness and disease. Although the risk of generating silica dust is low, ensure you work in a well-ventilated area and wear a respirator mask and disposable gloves.</li>
<li>If you run out of fresh silica gel granules in remote areas, used silica gel granules can be dried in a large pot (not used for cooking) on a stove or over a fire. Care should be taken not to scorch the desiccant as this can cause a loss of moisture capacity and breakdown of the indicator. When the indicator granules have returned to their original colour the silica gel granules are ready to be reused (Funk et al. 2017).</li>
