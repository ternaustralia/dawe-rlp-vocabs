   <h1 id="module-overview">Module overview</h1>
<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols</h2>
<p>This module includes two protocols to collect plant tissue vouchers
from a core monitoring plot:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/eea8280c-6ec7-48c9-9b9e-2418731ff005">Enhanced Protocol</a> – plant tissue vouchers from a single plant
collected for all species present in a plot, with at least five
replicate samples collected for the dominant perennial species and
species targeted in population genetics studies.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c20d9a04-702d-429a-ab5f-d7424cd2990d">Standard Protocol</a> – plant tissue vouchers from a single plant
collected for a subset of the species present in a plot (new, dominant
perennial, unknown, important, contentious, target and threatened
species; see <a href="#table-1">Table 1</a>). At least five replicate samples collected for the
dominant perennial species and species targeted in population genetics
studies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The two protocols include procedures for placing the vouchers into
synthetic-fibre bags, attaching voucher barcode labels, scanning voucher
barcodes into the Monitor app, and maintaining the stored vouchers.
Guidelines in each protocol provide further information on collection
and storage techniques and materials.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/eea8280c-6ec7-48c9-9b9e-2418731ff005">Enhanced Protocol</a> is best practice and recommended, particularly
for baseline surveys, periodic plot revisits (i.e. every 5–10 years),
projects directly involving molecular analysis, and projects where
correct species identification is critical.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c20d9a04-702d-429a-ab5f-d7424cd2990d">Standard Protocol</a> may be suitable for use during annual revisits
in plots where plant tissue vouchers have been previously collected.
This is intended to reduce survey time for revisits, while ensuring
there are plant tissue vouchers for key flora species for molecular
analyses.</p>
<p>In both protocols, five or more widely spaced replicate samples (see
<a href="#table-1">Table 1</a>) from the dominant perennial species (plus any target species)
are collected to facilitate population genetics analysis. </p>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Plant tissue vouchers are collected and stored to enable subsequent
molecular analyses, including DNA barcoding, population genetics, stable
isotope and leaf trait analyses. Molecular analysis of plant tissue adds
value to ecological monitoring programs as they support accurate plant
species identification (Nevill <em>et al.</em> 2020), identify
genetically important populations for conservation and restoration
(Hufford <em>et al.</em> 2012; Simmons <em>et al.</em> 2018), and detect
and provide insight into plant-environment interactions (Howard <em>et
al.</em> 2018; Harada <em>et al.</em> 2020; Munroe <em>et al.</em>
2021).</p>
<p>Plant tissue vouchers are collected into small synthetic-fibre bags
as they allow samples to dry rapidly and ensure high quality DNA can be
extracted (free from impurities). Synthetic teabags are ideal as they
are the perfect size and shape and hold together well, with a flap to
enclose the sample. The teabags are placed in a container with silica
gel granules in the base, which protects the samples from abrasion and
allows for the quick and easy replacement and reuse of silica gel
granules (Funk <em>et al.</em> 2017). Cotton teabags are not recommended
as there is a risk of contamination from cotton DNA.</p>
<p>DNA barcoding is a system that provides rapid, accurate and automated
species identifications by using short, standardised gene regions as
specific genetic markers (Kress <em>et al.</em> 2015). Its rapid growth
has led to an increased demand for plant tissue vouchers to be collected
and stored appropriately for analysis in plant systematics and
evolutionary studies (Funk <em>et al.</em> 2017; Liu <em>et al.</em>
2021), including the development of DNA barcode databases (Benson <em>et
al.</em> 2013; Costion <em>et al.</em> 2016; Dormontt <em>et al.</em>
2018; Nevill <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>
<p>The collection of plant tissue vouchers that can be used for DNA
barcoding is important, particularly for correctly identifying
threatened, data deficient and contentious species. Plant identification
based on morphological diagnosis alone has four significant limitations
(Hebert <em>et al.</em> 2003): (1) phenotypic plasticity and genetic
variability in the characters used to distinguish species can lead to
incorrect identifications; (2) morphologically cryptic species, which
are common in many groups (Kadereit <em>et al.</em> 2007; Sokoloff
<em>et al.</em> 2019), can be overlooked; (3) morphological keys are
often reliant on a particular life stage or gender; and (4) even with
modern interactive keys, a high level of expertise is often required,
meaning misidentifications can occur.</p>
<p>Plant tissue vouchers can also be used to assess genetic diversity
within and among plant populations, which has important consequences for
the composition and function of vegetation communities (Hughes <em>et
al.</em> 2008). Genetic diversity influences species interactions,
community structure, population recovery following disturbance,
functional trait variation and nutrient and energy fluxes (Whitham
<em>et al.</em> 2006; Hughes <em>et al.</em> 2008; Bell and Gonzalez
2009). Understanding genetic diversity is important for modelling
communities and has the potential to predict which species are more
likely to become extinct locally (i.e. those that may be already
struggling), and which are more likely to persevere (Simmons <em>et
al.</em> 2018).</p>
<p>Several authors recommend a minimum of 20–30, widely spaced samples
(see <a href="#table-1">Table 1</a>) per population for population genetics studies on plant
species (Cavers <em>et al.</em> 2005; Sinclair and Hobbs 2009; Hale
<em>et al.</em> 2012; Ottewell <em>et al.</em> 2016). In the Plant
Tissue Vouchering Module, plant tissue vouchers from five or more
individuals of each dominant perennial species are collected from a
plot. This relatively small minimum number of samples per plot considers
time, budget and sample storage restrictions, while ensuring that
samples are collected and stored appropriately. Furthermore, in project
areas that contain multiple plots, it is likely that the number of
samples collected for many species from within the entire project area,
and potentially the same population depending on the species, will be
greater than five. The assignment of individuals from across a project
area to genetic clusters through genetic structure analyses can increase
sample sizes for landscape, state wide or continental scale analysis
(Christmas <em>et al.</em> 2017). Replicate samples of a single species
are collected from individuals that are not direct neighbours and far
enough apart to minimise the risk of sampling closely related
individuals.</p>
<p>Stable isotope analysis of key elements essential for plant growth
(e.g. carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus) provides insight
into several ecosystem processes. This includes photosynthesis (Munroe
<em>et al.</em> 2021), nutrient acquisition and cycling (Reef <em>et
al.</em> 2014), competition and facilitation (Ens <em>et al.</em> 2015),
herbivory (Campbell and Vallano 2018), symbiotic relationships (Pate
<em>et al.</em> 1998), dieback (Harada <em>et al.</em> 2020), and
biogeography (Andrae <em>et al.</em> 2018). Information on processes
such as these is valuable for ecological monitoring since it can help to
explain the patterns observed in the environment and manage negative
processes and patterns (e.g. grassy weed invasion; Ens <em>et al.</em>
2015).</p>
<p>Plant traits reflect the ecological strategies of flora species,
including how they respond to environmental factors, affect other
trophic levels and influence ecosystem properties. Plant trait
measurements can therefore be used for a wide range of research
including evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, and
biogeography (Kattge <em>et al.</em> 2011). The assessment of plant
functional traits across environmental clines provides insight into the
mechanisms and drivers of trait variation, as well as into the
persistence and function of widespread species (Hulshof <em>et al.</em>
2013; Carlson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Inference can be made for these
species as to their likely success or failure under future climate
change and their suitability for revegetation projects (Laughlin 2014).
The collection of plant tissue vouchers allows for downstream analysis
of leaf traits such as specific leaf area, leaf area, leaf thickness,
photosynthesis and respiration, and nitrogen and phosphorous
concentration (Pérez-Harguindeguy <em>et al.</em> 2013), all of which
can provide insight into the conditions observed during ecological
surveys (e.g. physical signs of stress, morphological and genetic
variation). For example, specific leaf area and leaf area correlate well
with abiotic stressors including drought and nutrient availability
(Poorter <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;

     <h1 id="introduction-and-background">Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>The Plant Tissue Vouchering Module involves the collection, rapid
drying and appropriate storage of representative plant tissue (i.e.
leaf) vouchers from the vascular flora species within a core monitoring
plot. Plant tissue vouchers are collected to allow for various molecular
analyses to be undertaken, such as DNA barcoding, population genetics,
stable isotope and leaf trait analyses (Simmons <em>et al.</em> 2018;
Dong <em>et al.</em> 2020; Nevill <em>et al.</em> 2020; Munroe <em>et
al.</em> 2021). Note: molecular analysis methods and techniques are not
covered by this module, or any module in this manual.</p>
<p>The plant tissue vouchers ideally consist of approximately 10
cm<sup>2</sup> of young, undamaged leaves (or the best/freshest growth
that is on offer), which are stored in synthetic-fibre bags (e.g.
synthetic teabags) and rapidly dried using silica gel granules to
preserve the DNA (within 12–48 hours of collection; Funk et al.
2017).</p>
<p> The plant tissue vouchers are collected at the same time as the
plant specimen vouchers (see the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics Module</a>). A large or separate
specimen is collected to allow sufficient leaf material for plant tissue
vouchers without compromising the plant specimen voucher. The two
modules are linked in the Monitor app so that a plant tissue voucher can
be labelled with a unique voucher barcode label and scanned directly
into the app after the associated plant specimen voucher.</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
