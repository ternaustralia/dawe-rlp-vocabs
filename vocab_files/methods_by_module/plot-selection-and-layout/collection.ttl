   <h1 id="module-overview">Module overview</h1>
<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols</h2>
<p>This module covers two protocols for plot selection and layout:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/67e84ed4-fefa-4c75-afe4-8afdfdf0b2a0">Plot Selection Protocol</a> (desktop component).</p></li>
    <li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f411e246-6777-42b0-b755-32ca1784780b">Plot Layout and Visit Protocol</a> (field collection).</p></li>
    </ol>
<p>The Plot selection protocol includes procedures and guidelines for
defining the project area boundary, stratifying the project area into
sampling units and selecting proposed plot locations prior to field
collection based on a review of aerial imagery and spatial data.</p>
<p>The Plot layout and visit protocol includes procedures and guidelines
for selecting final plot locations in the field based on the results of
the stratification process in combination with on-ground knowledge of
the project area, marking out the plots and defining the plot visit, as
well as defining the current plot being surveyed from the existing plots
in the project area in order to work across multiple plots during a
visit (e.g. recording trap captures from multiple fauna plots each
morning and afternoon).</p>
<p>Plot types include the core monitoring plot (100 x 100 m; 1 ha) and
optional paired fauna plot (100 x 100 m; 1 ha), which together form the
biodiversity plot, where 2 ha bird surveys can be undertaken (<a href="#figure-1">Figure
1</a>).</p>
<h2 id="relationships-to-other-modules">Relationships to other
modules</h2>
<h3 id="mandatory-related-modules">Mandatory related modules</h3>
<p>The Plot Selection and Layout Module is not dependent on any other
module having been completed first. However, the Plot Selection Layout
Module is a mandatory pre-requisite for multiple modules to ensure the
plot is established with high accuracy. This includes the modules listed
below:</p>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Ecological assessments and monitoring programs require survey plots
that are representative of the environments within the project area
(Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020). The stratification process and the final
selection of plots in the field is important for the overall quality of
the assessment and the value of the data collected (Eyre <em>et al.</em>
2015). While purely random surveys are more statistically robust, they
require a larger sample size and have been shown to be less effective at
capturing ecological diversity, which is typically structured along
multiple environmental gradients (Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>
<p>Plots should be homogeneous in terms of vegetation and soil type,
slope and relief, and be representative of the sampling unit (Heard and
Channon 1997; Casson et al. 2009; White et al. 2012; Eyre et al. 2015;
Sparrow et al. 2020). Plots should be distributed in a way that ensures
as much of the variability present in the project area is sampled (White
et al. 2012), with more plots required for large or complex vegetation
associations (DEC 2004; Casson et al. 2009; Cleary et al. 2015; Eyre et
al. 2015).</p>
<p>Poor plot layout and positioning can not only make the initial survey
difficult but can also hinder any revisits (White <em>et al.</em> 2012).
In addition, poor designs make it hard to assess the effectiveness of
management interventions or the impacts of developments and may hinder
future decision making by presenting inaccurate results (Lindenmayer and
Likens 2010; Smokorowski and Randall 2017). Insufficient sampling
intensity and a lack of replication can also result in species not being
detected and the variation present across the project area not being
captured (Thompson and Thompson 2020).</p>
<p>The use of GNSS devices that are capable of obtaining sub-metre
accuracy facilitates precise recording of plot position (each corner and
centre point) and is important for repeatability in monitoring programs,
especially where plots are not permanently marked (Sparrow <em>et
al.</em> 2020). This will help to ensure that the same area is monitored
during each revisit, thereby maintaining good quality data (White <em>et
al.</em> 2012).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;

   <h1 id="introduction-and-background">Introduction and background</h1>
<p>Plot selection and layout should be approached in two stages:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li><p>Initial desktop stratification of the project area to identify
    key areas of interest and select proposed plot locations based on
    environmental, scientific, historical and logistical
    information.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2" type="1">
    <li><p>On-ground assessment of the project area based on the results of
    the desktop review.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>A desktop stratification assessment is a process to determine both
    the number and proposed location of plots within the project area. Areas
    are stratified depending on the size, aims, nature and location of the
    project. Stratification can occur at a range of scales, from broad
    levels such as bioregions and land systems through to finer scale
    measures such as vegetation type, topography and land management (White
    et al. 2012; Wood et al. 2015; Eyre et al. 2018; Guerin et al. 2021).
    The stratification process generally involves a desktop review of
    Geographical Information System (GIS) layers and satellite imagery to
    divide the area into sampling units and identify areas of priority for
    surveying. In some instances, this is followed by a reconnaissance field
    trip to evaluate the suitability of identified areas of interest (Heard
    and Channon 1997; Freeman et al. 2015; Wood et al. 2015). It is
    beneficial to identify more proposed plot locations during the desktop
    component than will ultimately be required as the suitability of
    proposed plots will need to be confirmed in the field (White et al.
    2012).</p>
    <p>Plot locations may be tailored to fit the purpose of the project and
    can include areas of different condition, management or treatment (i.e.
    control/impact). For monitoring programs, it is common for two
    contrasting condition states to be selected, which tend to be Best on
    Offer (BOO) sites and average condition sites (Eyre et al. 2011; White
    et al. 2012). Furthermore, if projects include on-ground management
    interventions or impacts associated with development activities,
    baseline data collected prior to works occurring allows any ecological
    changes taking place over time to be assessed (Manning et al. 2011).
    Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) designs are generally the most
    effective method to help isolate the effect of the intervention or
    development from natural variability (Smokorowski and Randall 2017).</p>
    <p>Plot types include the core monitoring plot and optional paired fauna
    plot, which together form the biodiversity plot, where 2 ha bird surveys
    can be undertaken (<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>). The majority of the plot-based modules are
    undertaken within the core monitoring plot. If establishing a fauna
    plot, it is preferred that it shares any common boundary (i.e. N/S/E/W)
    with the core monitoring plot. However, if this is not possible, the
    fauna plot should be within 50 m of the core monitoring plot, parallel
    or offset. The combined area is still referred to as the biodiversity
    plot. However, when 2 ha bird survey must encompass the entire fauna
    plot and as much of the core monitoring plot as possible to form the 2
    ha area.</p>
