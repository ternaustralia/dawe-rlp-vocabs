protocol</h1>
<h2 id="field-collection">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites-1">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Plot selection protocol (desktop component) is required to be
completed prior to the Plot layout and visit protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Undertaking the Vegetation Mapping Module first may assist with
plot selection in the field by providing an overview of the vegetation
communities present in the project area and help to determine the
suitability of the proposed plot locations.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-1">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Plot selection in the field time requirements will vary depending on
the size and complexity of the project area, and the number of plots
being established. As general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1–2 days for larger projects to traverse the project area
and confirm the location of suitable proposed plots in the
field.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Plot layout time requirements will depend on the vegetation structure
and density, the landform, the level of surveyor experience, the number
of locations being permanently marked and the number of plot grid points
(i.e. transect ends) required to be marked out based on the modules
required to meet the project biodiversity outcomes. A thick canopy may
also disrupt the GNSS/GPS location device, which will impact the time
required. As general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow between 30–60 minutes to lay out each plot.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If working across multiple plots during a visit:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1–2 minutes to define the current plot being surveyed from
the existing plots in the project area.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-1">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plot selection in the field can be undertaken by a single
surveyor. Selection must be undertaken by an experienced field surveyor
who can recognise a homogenous 100 x 100 m area that is representative
of the overall sampling unit. This surveyor must also be capable of
interpreting the information generated during the desktop stratification
stage.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot layout is best undertaken by two personnel, one marking out
the required plot components (i.e. placing pegs to mark transect end
points) and the other to providing directions for peg placement
according to the Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>If the plot is simultaneously being established for the Cover
Module (or any other module that requires tape measure placement), two
or more surveyors are recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyors must be familiar with using a tablet and GNSS
device. If surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to
practising and seeking advice before conducting this protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot selection in field and plot layout do not involve
interference with vegetation or wildlife. Therefore, scientific permits
and wildlife ethics approvals are unlikely to be required but always
check with your local authority. Access permissions will likely be
required.</p></li>

 <h3 id="additional-guidelines-1">Additional guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If plot name is not automatically generated, follow the TERN
naming convention (State, project code, bioregion code and 4-digit
sequential number) when defining plot names (Appendix 2). You may
additionally include the project number, and/or other identifiers to
identify control or impact sites, and the replicate number.</p></li>
<li><p>Use of star droppers is advised for permanently marking plots.
These droppers may be permanently labelled with an aluminium tag,
livestock tag or bright paint. This allows plots to be found easily and
assists with ongoing monitoring and revisits.</p></li>
<li><p>The four corners and centre of each plot should be permanently
marked using star droppers. In cases where this is not possible (some
Indigenous lands, private or leasehold lands, rocky outcrops, etc.) at
least one corner should be marked, especially if plots are to be
revisited. A note must be left within the Monitor app if the plot is not
permanently marked.</p></li>
<li><p>If pairing a fauna plot, consider the boundary of the core
monitoring plot where it will be placed as this may influence where you
permanently mark to plot/s.</p></li>
<li><p>If the plot selected has dense vegetation, clothes pegs with
flagging tape attached can be used in addition to tent pegs. Clothes
pegs should be placed directly above tent pegs on vegetation. If this is
not possible, the clothes peg should be placed in line with the tent
pegs.</p></li>
<li><p>Clothes pegs with flagging tape attached can be placed along the
boundary of the fauna plot to aid in viewing the plot boundaries during
the subsequent plot-based fauna surveys.</p></li>
<li><p>If required, transect lines can be displayed in the mapping
interface by selecting <em>transect lines</em>. These can be used to
align tape measures for the Cover Module.</p></li>

select the Plot layout and visit protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the create new plot button.</p></li>
<li><p>Select if the plot will be aligned to the cardinal directions or
not. As a standard, the plot aligns in a north-south direction with the
grid. If necessary, enter the <em>orientation</em> in degrees from north
to alter the plot orientation.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>plot name</em> from the list of proposed plots
generated in the Plot selection protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>plot type</em>. Select <em>Impact</em> or
<em>Control.</em> Select <em>Not applicable</em> if these categories do
not apply.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the plot <em>replicate</em> number (if the plot is the
first or only of its type, then the number will be 1).</p></li>
<li><p>Indicate whether the plot will be <em>permanently marked</em> and
if applicable, select what it will be <em>marked with</em> (e.g. star
dropper) and the points of the plot that will be <em>marked where</em>
(NE, NW, SE, SW, Centre). Marking at least one corner is highly
recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm the <em>plot dimensions</em> are 100 x 100 m. Future
versions of this module may allow alternate plot sizes.</p></li>

    <h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>
  Ecological assessments and monitoring programs require survey plots that are
  representative of the environments within the project area (Sparrow
  <em>et al.</em> 2020). The stratification process and the final selection of
  plots in the field is important for the overall quality of the assessment and
  the value of the data collected (Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015). While purely
  random surveys are more statistically robust, they require a larger sample
  size and have been shown to be less effective at capturing ecological
  diversity, which is typically structured along multiple environmental
  gradients (Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Poor plot layout and positioning can not only make the initial survey
  difficult but can also hinder any follow up surveys (White
  <em>et al.</em> 2012). In addition, poor designs make it hard to assess the
  effectiveness of management interventions or the impacts of developments and
  may hinder future decision making by presenting inaccurate results
  (Lindenmayer and Likens 2010; Smokorowski and Randall 2017). Insufficient
  sampling intensity and a lack of replication can also result in species not
  being detected and the variation present across the project area not being
  captured (Thompson and Thompson 2020).
</p>
<p>
  The use of the Trimble R1 allows recording of plot position (each corner and
  centre point) to sub-metre accuracy and is important for repeatability in
  monitoring programs, especially where plots are not permanently marked
  (Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020). This will help to ensure that the same area is
  monitored during each subsequent visit and thereby maintain good quality data
  (White <em>et al.</em> 2012).
