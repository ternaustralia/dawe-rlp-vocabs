    skos:note """<h3 id="additional-guidelines-1">Additional guidelines</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="survey-planning-and-reconnaissance-1">Survey
planning and reconnaissance </h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Refer to Table 2 for more information about recommended survey
approaches for each of the target pest species.</p></li>
<li><p>Vantage points should be placed at random within the study area
or selected in a way so that all representative vegetation types are
covered. It is acknowledged that for NRM projects, project coordinators
are likely to want to place vantage points in areas of known fauna
density and impact. It is important to also consider placing vantage
points in other areas of assumed low abundance.</p></li>
<li><p>The spacing between vantage points (and transects, if both survey
methods used) needs to be considered to minimise the chance of double
counting (i.e. counting the same individual at multiple
points/transects).</p></li>
<li><p>If distance sampling is the planned approach, the program
<em>Distance</em> has a survey design engine, with built in GIS, that
allows properties of different designs to be examined and survey plans
to be generated (Thomas et al. 2010).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="survey-timing">Survey timing</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Survey start times should reflect the ecology of the species
being surveyed. If diurnal and nocturnal surveys are being undertaken,
ensure that each is replicated over multiple days, and consistent
methods are used for each survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Duration of the vantage point survey is dependent on resources
and the logistics, especially if multiple surveys at different vantage
points will be expected to be completed each day/night. There is no
limitation to duration of each vantage point survey, however time of day
and weather conditions and the impact on animal activity and behaviour
should be considered in planning. For example, animal movements (and
therefore chance of detection) will change from first light to
mid-morning, and similarly from dusk to 3 hours post-dusk. As a minimum,
each vantage point survey should be 20 minutes, but could be as long as
3 hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally, each vantage point survey should be repeated for three
or four consecutive nights. Consequently, before commencing a survey,
ensure that this is possible and can be completed during times of
similar weather conditions and with the same observers.</p></li>
<li><p>If monitoring is to occur over a number of years, ensure the
methods selected can be used consistently over the life of the project,
and that enough replicates have been included to allow comparable data
to be collected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="equipment-3">Equipment</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the best available equipment. For diurnal vantage point
surveys, a good quality pair of binoculars is sufficient over a spotting
scope. Investments in emerging technologies such as thermal devices may
be beneficial for projects where nocturnal vantage point surveys are
identified as key monitoring methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Where possible, use the same equipment for each survey, and for
each repeated survey over-time. Any changes to the equipment are
recorded in the app.</p></li>
<li><p>Visual estimates of perpendicular distance are prone to error, so
laser rangefinders should be used where possible (Mitchell and Balogh
2007c), and are recommended for both diurnal and nocturnal
surveys.</p></li>
<li><p>Thermal devices should not be used exclusively monitoring
programs where minimum nightly temperatures exceed 30°C (McGregor et al.
2022).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="field-survey-1">Field survey</h4>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="personnel-requirements-3">Personnel
requirements</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>A field team of at least two people (spotter and recorder) is
recommended. Personnel must be able to visibly and audibly identify the
target species and be trained in identification and survey
techniques.</p></li>
<li><p>Observers will vary in their ability to count animals. To reduce
the effect of this variability, vantage point surveys should ideally be
surveyed by the same observer each survey period.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="weather-conditions-1">Weather conditions</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Surveys should only be conducted in good weather conditions, when
temperature, wind and rainfall are typical for the season. Poor weather
conditions will impact both animal movement, and chance of detection. If
conditions are not optimal, such as significantly
cooler/hotter/windier/wetter than expected, or if there’s fog or mist
reducing visibility, the survey should be re-scheduled. Wind is a
particularly important factor when detecting animals, therefore if it is
windier than a fresh wind (Beaufort scale 5, when small trees begin to
sway) consider re-scheduling.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather conditions must be recorded at the start of each transect
and can be adjusted at the completion of the transect if conditions
change.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are not using a weather station or temperature gauge, use
the Bureau of Meteorology website (or other weather apps) to estimate
the temperature at the time of the survey for the closest weather
station (data can be checked with the closest weather station after the
survey if needed).</p></li>
<li><p>Moon phase is recorded as it plays an important role in how
bright the night sky is, and therefore can impact animal activity and
movement. Either observe the moon or use the Bureau of Meteorology
website (or other weather apps) to determine the moon phase for the date
of the survey.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="repeat-counts">Repeat counts</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>There is no rule for when to repeat surveys. Surveys can be
repeated over multiple days to improve statistical accuracy of the
counts and abundance estimates. Surveys should be conducted as often as
the project requires, i.e. weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly,
annually. For consistency, ensure as many of the conditions are
repeated, i.e. similar weather, similar time (time after
sunrise/sunset), equipment, and observers.</p></li>
<li><p>Subsequent counts should start at the same time as the first
count and use the same vantage points, equipment and observers (Mitchell
and Balogh 2007a).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1-2 hours hour for survey planning.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20 – 60 minutes to complete the reconnaissance visit for
each vantage point (plus travel time to the location). This may include

<p>Personnel number and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vantage point surveys can be conducted by just one person, but
can be conducted with two people, either one making the observations and
one recording the data directly into the Monitor app, or two working
side by side and covering different fields of view.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor making the observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying the characteristic identifiable features of
the target species signs and how to distinguish these species apart. If
surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising,
using field reference guides, and seeking advice before conducting this
protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Vantage point surveys do not involve interference with wildlife.
Therefore scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are unlikely
to be required, but remember to always check with your local authority.
Access permissions are required.</p></li>
