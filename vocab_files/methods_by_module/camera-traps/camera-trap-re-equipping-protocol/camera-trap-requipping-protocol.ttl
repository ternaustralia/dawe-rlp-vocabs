protocol</h1>
<h2 id="field-collection-1">Field collection</h2>
<p>
    Remote cameras deliberately deployed at features of interest (e.g. suitable habitat, trail intersections, waterpoints, tree hollows, inflorescences) in the project area to maximise fauna detection, supplement species inventory, or record behaviour, with the option to capture video, orientate camera traps horizontally (i.e. downward-facing detection zone and field of view) to survey small mammals and reptiles, and use bait stations or lures.
    This module serves as a sub-protocol of the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f0123418-c565-45a6-be01-c5c332c727e5">Camera Trapping</a> module. 
    Prior to implementing this protocol, it is essential to thoroughly review the Introduction, Key Definitions and Terminology,
    Rationale, and Module Overview provided in the "<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f0123418-c565-45a6-be01-c5c332c727e5">Camera Trapping</a>" module.
    These sections will provide you with important contextual information and a comprehensive understanding of the protocol.
    </p>
<h3 id="pre-requisites-1">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>The following tasks need to be undertaken before commencing a
re-equipping field survey:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Camera trap identification, firmware update and settings
configuration (<a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>SD card identification and formatting (<a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Batteries preparation (<a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Desiccant installation (humid/wet conditions; <a href="#appendix-1">Appendix
1</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-1">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and
experience of personnel, the number of camera traps being re-equipped,
whether any damaged or missing camera traps need to be replaced, whether
additional equipment is being used and needs to be replaced, the level
of follow-up site preparation required at each camera trap point, the
size of the project area, and the level of difficulty in traversing the
project area.</p>
<p>As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow one week prior to the field survey to prepare replacement
camera traps, SD cards and batteries.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 5–20 minutes at each camera trap point, depending if
replacing a bait station or carcass.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow travel time between camera trap points.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the deployment period.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-1">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Personnel number and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Camera trap re-equipping and recording the data directly into the
app can be conducted by a single surveyor. However, it is best conducted
with two personnel, one re-equipping the camera traps, and the other
recording the data directly into the app.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor re-equipping the camera traps should be familiar
with and experienced in the operation and settings of the camera traps.
If surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising,
using instruction manuals, and seeking advice before conducting this
protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>For large project areas and camera trap arrays, camera trap
re-equipping is best conducted with two or more teams in separate
vehicles.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of camera traps involves interference with wildlife.
Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are likely
to be required, so always check with your local authority. Access
permissions are required.</p></li>
</ul>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
    rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm> ;
    skos:note """
<h3 id="additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>It is important to confirm whether or not the camera trap was
operational for the whole survey period. If there is no capture sequence
upon re-equipping of the camera trap it makes it impossible to know
whether it was operational for the full deployment period. For example,
if the last image occurs in week 3 of 4, this could reflect either no
animals at the camera trap point post week 3 or a camera malfunction
sometime after this capture.</p></li>
<li><p>If the SD card was full, it is recommended that the SD card is
replaced with one with greater storage capacity, or checking the SD card
storage at a shorter period to maintain camera trap
functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>If the batteries were flat, it is recommended that they be
checked at a shorter period to maintain camera trap
functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider if the site preparation might have caused false triggers
and undertake more clearance if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>If the camera trap was stolen or vandalised, consider the risk of
this happening again and if anti-theft devices and measures will be
enough to prevent this.</p></li>

survey tasks</h2></p>
<p><h3>Camera trap identification</h3></p>
<p>Before camera traps are deployed in the field they need to be
allocated and marked with an identification number. Camera traps should
also be registered in an equipment management database (e.g.
spreadsheet) to keep track of their location (e.g. in storage, assigned
to project #), current firmware, and operational status (e.g.
functional, damaged; TEAM Network 2011).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Clearly mark the camera trap externally with a unique
identification number (e.g. 01, 02, 03) using a permanent,
water-resistant marker.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Open the camera trap and mark it internally with the same unique
identification number as marked externally.</p></li>
<li><p>Retrieve the serial number of the camera trap from the white
sticker underneath the control panel.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>camera trap number</em> and <em>camera trap serial
number</em> in an equipment management database. Other data you may wish
to record includes the camera trap <em>make</em>, <em>model</em>,
<em>purchase</em> <em>date</em>, <em>firmware</em>, <em>operational</em>
<em>status</em> and <em>current location</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 1–4 for each camera trap.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h3>Camera trap firmware update</h3></p>
<p>Camera trap manufacturers regularly provide firmware updates for
their camera traps. Ensure you check the relevant website for updates
and instructions for updating before each field survey or camera trap
redeployment. As an example, the steps to update the firmware on Reconyx
camera traps are provided below (Bush Heritage Australia 2021).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Navigate to the <em>support</em> tab and <em>firmware
updates</em> link on the <a href="https://www.reconyx.com/">Reconyx
website</a> to access the most recent firmware update. Updates are
provided on an approximately annual basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the list of Reconyx camera trap models for the relevant
update. HC500, HC550, HC600 and PC850 models generally all have the same
update.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload the firmware update onto an empty SD card.</p></li>
<li><p>Insert the SD card into your Reconyx camera trap.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch on your Reconyx camera trap and firmware updates will
automatically occur.</p></li>
<li><p>Reconyx firmware updates since 2016 have maintained the current
camera trap settings. Check or set camera trap settings after firmware
updates are completed.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Repeat steps 4–6 for all remaining Reconyx camera traps.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h3>Camera trap settings configuration</h3></p>
<p>Configure your camera trap settings before going into the field.
Refer to the user manual for your camera trap make and model for
instructions to navigate the control panel.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the camera trap and insert a spare set of batteries to
configure the settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch the camera trap on and navigate to the control menu based
on the user manual for your camera trap.</p></li>
<li><p>Select a pre-programmed settings option, or program customised
settings (see following steps).</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>media type</em> (i.e. image and/or video).</p></li>
<li><p>For images, set the number of <em>images per
trigger</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>For images, set the <em>image interval</em> in seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>For videos, set the <em>video length</em> in minutes and
seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>sensor sensitivity</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>quiet period</em> in minutes and seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>aspect ratio</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>For images, set the <em>image quality</em> in
megapixels.</p></li>
<li><p>For videos, set the <em>video resolution</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set <em>time lapse (on/off)</em>. If turned on, set the <em>time
lapse interval</em> in minutes and seconds, and <em>time lapse
schedules</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set <em>day/night recording</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>night mode shutter speed</em> in seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>time format</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>date</em> and <em>time</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>unit of temperature</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>user label</em> (i.e. relevant project, camera and/or
camera trap point code).</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li><p>Set the <em>battery type</em> to match the batteries that will be
used during the survey.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="21" type="1">
<li><p>Repeat steps 1–20 for each camera trap.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h3>SD card identification</h3></p>
<p>Before SD cards are used in camera traps that are deployed in the
field, they need to be allocated and marked with an identification
number. Similar to camera traps, SD cards should also be registered in
an equipment management database to keep track of their location (e.g.
in storage, assigned to project #, assigned to camera #) and operational
status (e.g. functional, damaged; TEAM Network 2011).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Clearly mark the SD card externally with a unique identification
number (e.g. 01, 02, 03) using a permanent, water resistant
marker.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Retrieve the serial number of the SD card from the back of the SD
card.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>SD card number</em> and <em>SD card serial
number</em> of each SD card in an equipment management database. Other
data you may wish to record includes the SD card <em>brand</em>,
<em>type</em> (SD, SDHC, SDHX), <em>purchase</em> <em>date</em>,
<em>storage capacity</em>, <em>format</em> (e.g. FAT32), <em>format
date</em>, and <em>current location</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 1–3 for each SD card.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h3>SD card formatting</h3></p>
<p>Formatting an SD card effectively erases all the card data, giving
you a fresh, empty folder structure to work with. After you have backed
up your SD card after each field survey, you should format each SD card
before the next field survey. This will ensure data from different
surveys is not mixed up. Furthermore, regular formatting of SD cards can
lower the risk of corrupt files.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ensure your data from the previous field survey is backed
up.</p></li>
<li><p>Insert the SD card into your computer’s SD card reader (or use an
external SD card reader).</p></li>
<li><p>For Windows, you should see your SD card under the list of
available drives. Right-click on the drive and select <em>format</em>.
Under <em>file system</em> select ‘FAT32’ if the SD card is 32 GB or
smaller. If the SD card is 64 GB or greater, select ‘ExFAT’ then click
on <em>start</em>. Select <em>ok</em> to ignore the warning that the
data on the drive will be erased and begin formatting the SD
card.</p></li>
<li><p>For Mac, open disk utility and select the SD card on the left
side of the window. Click on the <em>erase</em> tab and then click on
the <em>format</em> drop-down menu. Select ‘MS-DOS (FAT)’ if the SD card
is 32 GB or smaller. If the SD card is 64 GB or greater, select ‘ExFAT’.
Click <em>erase</em>. Your Mac will delete the contents of your SD card
and format it.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the SD card <em>format</em> and <em>format date</em> of
each SD card in an equipment management database.</p></li>
<li><p>Insert the formatted SD card into a camera trap so it is ready
for the survey.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Repeat steps 1–6 for each SD card.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="anchor" id="_Batteries"></span><h3>Batteries preparation</h3></p>
<p>Each camera trap can require up to 12 AA batteries depending on the
make and model. Batteries should be selected after consulting the user
manual of the camera traps you are using and consideration of your study
requirements. The three most common battery types used are rechargeable
nickel-metal hydride (NiMH), lithium and alkaline.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If using rechargeable NiMH batteries and charging the batteries
for the first time, or the first time for a given field season, put them
in a discharging-recharging cycle (conditioning cycle) at least 48 hours
before leaving for the field. This ensures that the battery memory is
properly set and prolongs the life of the rechargeable battery. Refer to
the battery charger for instructions to put the batteries into a
condition cycle. Only use battery chargers that have this specification.
Depending on the number of camera traps you have, multiple large battery
chargers may be required to be used in parallel to prepare for the
field.</p></li>
<li><p>If not charging the rechargeable NiMH batteries for the first
time, discharge them first and recharge them for at least 24 hours
before leaving for the field survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the rechargeable NiMH batteries are finished charging, check
they have adequate voltage using a voltmeter. Rechargeable batteries
will show a lower voltage than their posted voltage of 1.5 V, but this
is normal for these battery types (between 1.25 and 1.3 V).</p></li>
<li><p>Try not to charge the rechargeable NiMH batteries more than 2–3
days before taking them into the field.</p></li>
<li><p>Within 1–2 days of the field survey, insert new lithium or
alkaline, or charged NiMH batteries into each camera trap so they are
ready for the survey. Do not mix battery types.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>Do not use the rechargeable NiMH batteries prepared for the field
survey to configure the camera trap settings (see above). Use a spare
set of batteries.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h3>Desiccant installation</h3></p>
<p>If the camera traps are being deployed in humid or wet conditions,
desiccant (silica gel) can be placed inside the camera trap housings to
help protect the electronics from moisture.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the camera trap housing and place a packet of desiccant
inside.</p></li>
<li><p>Close the camera trap housing.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Repeat steps 1–2 for each camera trap.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h3>Camera trap array development and upload</h3></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Review ecological information for the target taxa/species to
inform the number, spacing and shape of the camera trap array. GIS
spatial data layers (e.g. vegetation mapping, access tracks, landform),
along with any other information relevant to the project, are also
useful in determining an array.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload a csv file of the proposed array with ‘Name’, ‘Latitude’
and ‘Longitude’ columns, with latitude and longitude in decimal degrees,
to your device.</p></li>
