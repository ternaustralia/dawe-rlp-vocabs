    <h1 id="camera-trap-deployment-protocol">Camera Trap Deployment
protocol</h1>
 <p>
    Many camera traps (e.g. 20–30) deployed in a systematic array (e.g. grid, transect) to monitor fauna occupancy and density in the project area (via downstream capture-mark-recapture methods and random encounter models).
    This module serves as a sub-protocol of the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f0123418-c565-45a6-be01-c5c332c727e5">Camera Trapping</a> module. 
    Prior to implementing this protocol, it is essential to thoroughly review the Introduction, Key Definitions and Terminology,
    Rationale, and Module Overview provided in the "<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f0123418-c565-45a6-be01-c5c332c727e5">Camera Trapping</a>" module.
    These sections will provide you with important contextual information and a comprehensive understanding of the protocol.
    </p>
<h2 id="field-collection">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>To ensure the integrity and quality of the data collected, camera
traps must be in proper functioning order. Adequate care and maintenance
of the required equipment is essential and close attention must be paid
when preparing and calibrating the camera traps before they are deployed
in the field.</p>
<p>The following tasks need to be undertaken before commencing a
deployment field survey:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Camera trap identification, firmware update and settings
configuration (<a href="#appendix_deployment">Appendix 1</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>SD card identification and formatting (<a href="#appendix_deployment">Appendix 1</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Batteries preparation (<a href="#appendix_deployment">Appendix 1</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Desiccant installation (humid/wet conditions; <a href="#appendix_deployment">Appendix
1</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Camera trap array development and upload (<a href="#appendix_deployment">Appendix 1</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Study design and planning considerations (<a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and
experience of personnel, the number of camera traps being deployed,
whether additional equipment is being used (e.g. bait stations, drift
fence), the level of site preparation required at each camera trap
point, the size of the project area, and the level of difficulty in
traversing the project area.</p>
<p>As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow one week prior to the field survey to prepare camera traps,
SD cards, batteries and camera trap arrays.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 10–30 minutes at each camera trap point, depending if
installing a bait station or carcass.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow travel time between camera trap points.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the deployment period.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Personnel number and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Camera trap deployment is best conducted with two personnel, one
setting up the camera traps, and the other recording the data directly
into the app.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor deploying the camera traps should be familiar with
and experienced in the operation and settings of the camera traps. If
surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising,
using instruction manuals, and seeking advice before conducting this
protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>For large project areas and camera trap arrays, camera trap
deployment is best conducted with two or more teams in separate
vehicles.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of camera traps involves interference with wildlife.
Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are likely
to be required, so always check with your local authority. Access
permissions are required.</p></li>

<h3 id="additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</h3>
<p>The following points are adapted from Gillespie <em>et al.</em>
(2015), Molloy (2018) and TEAM Network (2011).</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="traversing-the-project-area">Traversing the
project area</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Disturbance of the project area should be minimised by using
existing tracks and trails or establishing temporary access routes that
can be used simultaneously to undertake multiple modules.</p></li>
<li><p>Some camera trap points may need to be traversed to on
foot.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="camera-trap-deployment">Camera trap
deployment</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Look for features of interests, where fauna activity is likely to
be high (e.g. water points, trail intersections).</p></li>
<li><p>Look for signs of animal paths, or natural openings through the
area, such as adjacent to rock ledges or creek beds; also place camera
traps in areas with contrasting vegetation structures, such as densely
vegetated versus open areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Opportune observations may also give an indication of areas that
could be targeted.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid deploying camera traps in areas where there is a risk of
inundation during the deployment period.</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy camera traps so that they are orientated south to prevent
glare and sun damage to the camera lens and sensor, and to reduce false
triggers from the rising and setting of the sun.</p></li>
<li><p>There is evidence of overheating and malfunction of camera trap
batteries on days where daytime temperatures exceed 40°C. Depending on
the location and time of year, shade may need to be provided to protect
the back of the camera trap from sun exposure (Dundas <em>et al.</em>
2019).</p></li>
<li><p>If possible, try to deploy camera traps so they are on an angle
relative to animal paths.</p></li>
<li><p>In sloped terrain, camera traps should be angled and parallel to
the ground to ensure detection.</p></li>
<li><p>Level camera trap points are preferable as they provide
undistorted and unobstructed view of subjects, particularly smaller
animals. Downward slopes increase the size of blind zones (although this
can be partially rectified by angling the camera trap downward) and
upward slopes reduce the photographed area and proved a greater
opportunity for concealment by increasing the effect of on ground
structures.</p></li>
<li><p>If camera traps are deployed in a Fauna Plot while ground
trapping is being undertaken, take care to avoid ground trapping near
detection zones to prevent false triggers.</p></li>
<li><p>Refer to the relevant camera trap make and model user manuals for
guidance in the operation and functionality of the camera
traps.</p></li>
<li><p>Check that the housing of each camera trap is properly closed to
prevent moisture damaging the electronics.</p></li>
<li><p>All camera traps used in a survey should all be set up with the
same settings. Refer to <a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a> for a summary of informed camera trap
settings for different taxa.</p></li>
<li><p>An angle bracket can be used to orientate the camera trap
horizontally (i.e. downward-facing detection zone and field of view) to
survey small mammals and reptiles (e.g. Dundas <em>et al.</em> 2019;
Moore <em>et al.</em> 2020b).</p></li>
<li><p>Where camera trap points are in a regular grid or transect array,
distance between points can be recorded as a single value. However,
where camera trap points are randomly or irregularly located, the
distance to the closest point is recorded, which allows for values such
as the average, minimum and maximum distance among the points, along
with a measure of the distribution of distances (e.g. standard
deviation).</p></li>
<li><p>Theft and vandalism inevitably occur. Consider the risk of this
in your project area and use anti-theft devices. Cable-locking camera
traps or using security boxes will act as a deterrent and is advisable
in areas with high human visitation or if setting camera traps along
vehicle or walking tracks.</p></li>
<li><p>When multiple camera traps are deployed it is advisable to use
combination locks, or have locks keyed-alike, to avoid having to carry
multiple keys into the field. Coil excess cable length up off the
ground.</p></li>
<li><p>In many cases, people who discover cameras may not disturb them,
but will be curious about why they are there. Attaching a small sign to
the side of each camera with a brief description of the project and some
contact information is likely to satisfy curiosity and may help to limit
vandalism or other interference.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimise animal interference of camera traps by securing them
tightly, securing the door with a cable tie, or placing the camera trap
inside a metal security box. Reconyx manufacture sturdy metal cases for
their cameras for additional protection if needed.</p></li>

<p><span class="anchor" id="appendix_deployment"></span><h2>Appendix 1. Pre-field
survey tasks</h2></p>
<p><h3>Camera trap identification</h3></p>
<p>Before camera traps are deployed in the field they need to be
allocated and marked with an identification number. Camera traps should
also be registered in an equipment management database (e.g.
spreadsheet) to keep track of their location (e.g. in storage, assigned
to project #), current firmware, and operational status (e.g.
functional, damaged; TEAM Network 2011).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Clearly mark the camera trap externally with a unique
identification number (e.g. 01, 02, 03) using a permanent,
water-resistant marker.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Open the camera trap and mark it internally with the same unique
identification number as marked externally.</p></li>
<li><p>Retrieve the serial number of the camera trap from the white
sticker underneath the control panel.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>camera trap number</em> and <em>camera trap serial
number</em> in an equipment management database. Other data you may wish
to record includes the camera trap <em>make</em>, <em>model</em>,
<em>purchase</em> <em>date</em>, <em>firmware</em>, <em>operational</em>
<em>status</em> and <em>current location</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 1–4 for each camera trap.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h3>Camera trap firmware update</h3></p>
<p>Camera trap manufacturers regularly provide firmware updates for
their camera traps. Ensure you check the relevant website for updates
and instructions for updating before each field survey or camera trap
redeployment. As an example, the steps to update the firmware on Reconyx
camera traps are provided below (Bush Heritage Australia 2021).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Navigate to the <em>support</em> tab and <em>firmware
updates</em> link on the <a href="https://www.reconyx.com/">Reconyx
website</a> to access the most recent firmware update. Updates are
provided on an approximately annual basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the list of Reconyx camera trap models for the relevant
update. HC500, HC550, HC600 and PC850 models generally all have the same
update.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload the firmware update onto an empty SD card.</p></li>
<li><p>Insert the SD card into your Reconyx camera trap.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch on your Reconyx camera trap and firmware updates will
automatically occur.</p></li>
<li><p>Reconyx firmware updates since 2016 have maintained the current
camera trap settings. Check or set camera trap settings after firmware
updates are completed.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Repeat steps 4–6 for all remaining Reconyx camera traps.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h3>Camera trap settings configuration</h3></p>
<p>Configure your camera trap settings before going into the field.
Refer to the user manual for your camera trap make and model for
instructions to navigate the control panel.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the camera trap and insert a spare set of batteries to
configure the settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch the camera trap on and navigate to the control menu based
on the user manual for your camera trap.</p></li>
<li><p>Select a pre-programmed settings option, or program customised
settings (see following steps).</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>media type</em> (i.e. image and/or video).</p></li>
<li><p>For images, set the number of <em>images per
trigger</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>For images, set the <em>image interval</em> in seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>For videos, set the <em>video length</em> in minutes and
seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>sensor sensitivity</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>quiet period</em> in minutes and seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>aspect ratio</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>For images, set the <em>image quality</em> in
megapixels.</p></li>
<li><p>For videos, set the <em>video resolution</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set <em>time lapse (on/off)</em>. If turned on, set the <em>time
lapse interval</em> in minutes and seconds, and <em>time lapse
schedules</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set <em>day/night recording</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>night mode shutter speed</em> in seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>time format</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>date</em> and <em>time</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>unit of temperature</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <em>user label</em> (i.e. relevant project, camera and/or
camera trap point code).</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li><p>Set the <em>battery type</em> to match the batteries that will be
used during the survey.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="21" type="1">
<li><p>Repeat steps 1–20 for each camera trap.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h3>SD card identification</h3></p>
<p>Before SD cards are used in camera traps that are deployed in the
field, they need to be allocated and marked with an identification
number. Similar to camera traps, SD cards should also be registered in
an equipment management database to keep track of their location (e.g.
in storage, assigned to project #, assigned to camera #) and operational
status (e.g. functional, damaged; TEAM Network 2011).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Clearly mark the SD card externally with a unique identification
number (e.g. 01, 02, 03) using a permanent, water resistant
marker.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Retrieve the serial number of the SD card from the back of the SD
card.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>SD card number</em> and <em>SD card serial
number</em> of each SD card in an equipment management database. Other
data you may wish to record includes the SD card <em>brand</em>,
<em>type</em> (SD, SDHC, SDHX), <em>purchase</em> <em>date</em>,
<em>storage capacity</em>, <em>format</em> (e.g. FAT32), <em>format
date</em>, and <em>current location</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 1–3 for each SD card.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h3>SD card formatting</h3></p>
<p>Formatting an SD card effectively erases all the card data, giving
you a fresh, empty folder structure to work with. After you have backed
up your SD card after each field survey, you should format each SD card
before the next field survey. This will ensure data from different
surveys is not mixed up. Furthermore, regular formatting of SD cards can
lower the risk of corrupt files.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ensure your data from the previous field survey is backed
up.</p></li>
<li><p>Insert the SD card into your computer’s SD card reader (or use an
external SD card reader).</p></li>
<li><p>For Windows, you should see your SD card under the list of
available drives. Right-click on the drive and select <em>format</em>.
Under <em>file system</em> select ‘FAT32’ if the SD card is 32 GB or
smaller. If the SD card is 64 GB or greater, select ‘ExFAT’ then click
on <em>start</em>. Select <em>ok</em> to ignore the warning that the
data on the drive will be erased and begin formatting the SD
card.</p></li>
<li><p>For Mac, open disk utility and select the SD card on the left
side of the window. Click on the <em>erase</em> tab and then click on
the <em>format</em> drop-down menu. Select ‘MS-DOS (FAT)’ if the SD card
is 32 GB or smaller. If the SD card is 64 GB or greater, select ‘ExFAT’.
Click <em>erase</em>. Your Mac will delete the contents of your SD card
and format it.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the SD card <em>format</em> and <em>format date</em> of
each SD card in an equipment management database.</p></li>
<li><p>Insert the formatted SD card into a camera trap so it is ready
for the survey.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Repeat steps 1–6 for each SD card.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="anchor" id="_Batteries"></span><h3>Batteries preparation</h3></p>
<p>Each camera trap can require up to 12 AA batteries depending on the
make and model. Batteries should be selected after consulting the user
manual of the camera traps you are using and consideration of your study
requirements. The three most common battery types used are rechargeable
nickel-metal hydride (NiMH), lithium and alkaline.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If using rechargeable NiMH batteries and charging the batteries
for the first time, or the first time for a given field season, put them
in a discharging-recharging cycle (conditioning cycle) at least 48 hours
before leaving for the field. This ensures that the battery memory is
properly set and prolongs the life of the rechargeable battery. Refer to
the battery charger for instructions to put the batteries into a
condition cycle. Only use battery chargers that have this specification.
Depending on the number of camera traps you have, multiple large battery
chargers may be required to be used in parallel to prepare for the
field.</p></li>
<li><p>If not charging the rechargeable NiMH batteries for the first
time, discharge them first and recharge them for at least 24 hours
before leaving for the field survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the rechargeable NiMH batteries are finished charging, check
they have adequate voltage using a voltmeter. Rechargeable batteries
will show a lower voltage than their posted voltage of 1.5 V, but this
is normal for these battery types (between 1.25 and 1.3 V).</p></li>
<li><p>Try not to charge the rechargeable NiMH batteries more than 2–3
days before taking them into the field.</p></li>
<li><p>Within 1–2 days of the field survey, insert new lithium or
alkaline, or charged NiMH batteries into each camera trap so they are
ready for the survey. Do not mix battery types.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>Do not use the rechargeable NiMH batteries prepared for the field
survey to configure the camera trap settings (see above). Use a spare
set of batteries.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h3>Desiccant installation</h3></p>
<p>If the camera traps are being deployed in humid or wet conditions,
desiccant (silica gel) can be placed inside the camera trap housings to
help protect the electronics from moisture.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the camera trap housing and place a packet of desiccant
inside.</p></li>
<li><p>Close the camera trap housing.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Repeat steps 1–2 for each camera trap.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h3>Camera trap array development and upload</h3></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Review ecological information for the target taxa/species to
inform the number, spacing and shape of the camera trap array. GIS
spatial data layers (e.g. vegetation mapping, access tracks, landform),
along with any other information relevant to the project, are also
useful in determining an array.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload a csv file of the proposed array with ‘Name’, ‘Latitude’
and ‘Longitude’ columns, with latitude and longitude in decimal degrees,
to your device.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="anchor" id="appendix-2"></span><h2>Appendix 2. Study
design and planning considerations</h2></p>
<p>Proper attention must be given to the design of camera trapping
studies, including the target species, the make and model of the camera
trap used, the camera settings used, the mode of camera trap deployment,
and what data is collected and how it will be analysed. Poorly designed
surveys often result in data which cannot be used to answer the question
of interest (Gillespie et al. 2015). A clear and defined statement of
the study objectives and why camera traps are the best survey tool to
achieve these objectives is therefore an important component of camera
trapping studies. The study design and methodology should align with the
clearly defined objectives (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a).</p>
<p>Study design and planning considerations for camera trapping surveys
are detailed in the sections below, and cover:</p>

<p><h4>Camera trap decision key</p></h4>
<p>The following decision key (below) will help you determine whether or
not camera traps are suitable to use and for what purpose, based on the
objectives of your survey, the available resources and the target
species (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>

<p><h3>Factors affecting detection</h3></p>
<p>Like any fauna survey methodology, camera trap surveys must address
common sources of sampling error to reliably assess animal populations.
This includes imperfect detection – where individuals or species present
within a sampling are not always detected. Camera trap surveys, which
sample mobile species, must consider imperfect detection at the camera
trap scale, where fauna passing through the relatively small camera trap
detection zone fail to be detected, and at the study area scale, where
fauna using the study area that the camera trap is assumed to sample
fail to be detected (see figure below; Burton <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>The probability of detection (i.e. the probability that a species
will be detected during a survey if it is present within the study area;
Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015) is affected by several factors at the
camera trap scale, including camera trap specifications, mode of
deployment, animal body size and temperature, animal speed of movement,
behaviour and group size, ambient temperature and light, and vegetation
and other obstructions, as well as at the study area scale, including
animal density and movement, the size and selection of sampling units,
the number and location of camera traps, the use of attractant, the
deployment period, and analytical assumptions (Burton <em>et al.</em>
2015). Consideration of these factors (see below) and following the
carefully planned camera trapping protocol are imperative to reduce
detection bias in camera trap field data collection. However,
researchers will need to consider analytical approaches to contend with
imperfect detection when undertaking downstream analyses (e.g.
capture-mark-recapture methods, random encounter models).</p>

<p>Factors affecting camera trap detection.</p>
<p><em>The detection of fauna by camera traps is affected by ecological
and observational processes occurring at the broader, landscape scale
and local, camera trap detection zone scale (Burton et al.
2015).</em></p>
<p><h3>Target species</h3></p>
<p>The target species, suites of species, or community of interest
should be clearly identified when planning camera trap surveys. This is
because the study design, camera trap model, camera trap point
selection, mode of deployment, camera trap settings, use and type of
lure, number and density of cameras, and deployment period should be
tailored to the target fauna to maximise detection probability (Harmsen
<em>et al.</em> 2010; Rovero <em>et al.</em> 2013; Diete <em>et al.</em>
2015; Fancourt <em>et al.</em> 2018; Moore <em>et al.</em> 2020a).
Consideration should be given to the size, behaviour, diagnostic
characteristics, home range and mode of body temperature regulation of
the target fauna.</p>
<p>Deployment recommendations for various Australian taxa (e.g. small,
medium-sized and large mammals, invasive predators, reptiles) are
summarised in the <em>Quick reference deployment guidelines</em> above.
Furthermore, deployment recommendations for different species, relating
to each of the factors mentioned above, are discussed in the
corresponding sections below.</p>
<p><h3>Camera trap selection</h3></p>
<p>The make and model of the camera traps used in a survey have
important consequences for species detectability and the interpretation
and repeatability of results. There are numerous manufacturers (e.g.
Reconyx, Pixcontroller, Buckeye, Cuddeback, Bushnell, Scoutguard) that
typically have multiple camera trap models available. These makes and
models vary in their cost, trigger speed, detection zone, sensor
sensitivity, how they detect fauna (e.g. PIR or AIR sensors), how they
illuminate the scene at night (e.g. white or infrared flash), and
battery life, among others (see table below). Websites such as <a href="https://www.trailcampro.com/">TrailCamPro.com</a> provide
comparative performance statistics as well specifications for many
popular models (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a). The camera trap features
that should be evaluated when selecting a camera trap model are
summarised in the table below. Only a single model of camera trap should
be used in a study because performance is likely to vary among
models.</p>
<p>Recording the make and model (including the manufacturing year for
models that are updated frequently but keep the same name) of the camera
traps used in a study ensures repeatability of the methods and
comparability of the results, both among projects and monitoring surveys
within the same project. Data of the remaining camera trap features
summarised in the table below should also be collected with the camera
trap make, model and year as these features are not always apparent.</p>
<p>There are many examples where a poor choice in camera traps can
negatively affect data and outcomes. For example, images captured with
infrared flash are monochrome and of relatively low resolution compared
to those taken with a white light flash. If using camera traps to survey
small mammals, models with white flash will likely be required to
capture the characteristic features required to distinguish
similar-looking sympatric species with an acceptable level of precision
(Meek and Vernes 2015). The possibility that the species of interest
might be disturbed by a white light flash or the noises made by cameras
and subsequently avoid the camera is also an important consideration
(Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Furthermore, studies of animal refuge
use (e.g. burrows, tree hollows) may be better carried out using camera
traps with an AIR sensor, rather than a PIR sensor, and choosing a
camera trap with a small detection zone and a slow trigger response may
be unsuccessful in detecting small and fast-moving animals at close
range (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a).</p>
<p>Reconyx Hyperfire camera traps are the most widely used camera trap
for wildlife research (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012b; Meek <em>et al.</em>
2015; Meek 2018). Protocols that specify the use of Reconyx camera traps
in Australia include the <em>Standard Operating Procedure for Camera
Trapping in Northern Australia</em> developed by the Department of
Environment, Parks and Water Security (Northern Territory Government;
Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015), and Bush Heritage Australia’s
<em>Camera Trap Guidelines</em> (Bush Heritage Australia 2021). Both
protocols use Reconyx HC550 or PC850 camera for data consistency and
comparability. These models have similar specifications and setting
options, as well as LED white flash capability, which importantly allows
colour images to be captured during the day and night, and significantly
improves species identification capability (Gillespie <em>et al.</em>
2015). Internationally, the <em>Terrestrial Vertebrate (formerly Camera
Trap) Monitoring Protocol</em> requires the use of Reconyx camera traps,
particularly the HC500 or PC800 models, depending on the site’s climate
(PC800 models used in humid climates). This is due to their rapid
response time, infrared flash, multi-fire capabilities and unique design
for field conditions (TEAM Network 2011).</p>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Sensor (PIR or AIR)</td>
<td>Most camera traps have passive infrared (PIR) sensor, which detect a
differential in temperature and motion between a subject and the
background temperature. When ambient temperature falls within the body
temperature range of most mammals (31.5–36.5° C), PIR camera traps can
be unreliable. PIR sensors can also be triggered by the movement of
pockets of hot air or by the motion of warm vegetation in the detection
zone. This problem can be limited by avoiding pointing the camera trap
directly to a background that is under sun incidence. Active infrared
(AIR) sensors, which respond to a break in an infrared beam between two
units spaced apart, are not widely used but may, for example, be
suitable for studies of animal use of burrows or tree hollows.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Trigger speed</td>
<td>A fundamental feature of camera traps, if not the critical feature.
Fast trigger speeds are necessary to capture fast moving targets. Fast
trigger speeds may be less necessary if using a bait station as fauna
generally stay in the detection zone for longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Flash type (white or infrared)</td>
<td>Camera traps with white flash are critical to capture sharp and
colour images at night as well as during the day. This is fundamental in
studies that require individual recognition or for faunal inventories,
as colour images aid identification. Currently, classic Xenon white
flashes produce sharper images than white LED flashes due to their
greater power and flash duration. Camera traps with infrared flash use
arrays of LEDs that emit infrared light. The images captured are often
in grey-scale or may have a reddish-pink tinge. Infrared flashes tend to
be less obvious to fauna, use less energy and tend to have quicker
trigger speeds than white flashes. Recently, no-glow (also called
“black”) infrared flashes have been introduced to minimise the red glow
emitted by standard infrared LEDs which is seen by animals. A limited
number of PIR camera trap models (e.g. Spypoint, Bolymedia) have dual
flashes (Xenon and infrared).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Detection zone</td>
<td>Critical feature that varies widely among current models (15.8–324.1
m; Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Camera traps with a narrow detection
zone (i.e. smaller than the field of view) usually have fast trigger
speeds and will take the photo when the animal is well within the field
of view. The detection zone can be increased to some extent by moving
the camera trap further away from the target, which can compensate for
slow trigger speeds.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Number of photos taken, recovery time, and video</td>
<td>Capability to capture bursts of images in rapid sequence (i.e. fast
recovery time) may be important for improved species identification (as
chances of obtaining a good image within a burst will be increased),
recording individuals within family groups and packs, and analysis of
passing sequences to derive day range, which is a critical parameter in
the Random Encounter Model (REM; Rowcliffe <em>et al.</em> 2008). At
night, Xenon white flash cameras are unable to take photo bursts or
videos due to the flash recharge time, which can take ≥ 30 seconds, a
limitation that is overcome by LED white flash camera traps. Rapid image
sequences and video can be useful for behavioural studies or specific
research needs. However, data handling is more time consuming, SD cards
are filled quicker and power consumption is greater, hence videos are
not recommended when photographs alone provide sufficient data.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>PIR sensitivity</td>
<td>Regulates the sensor responsiveness to the target by changing the
heat sensitivity threshold. High sensitivity is generally better to
detect small-sized animals. However, this will increase chance of false
triggers caused by warm, moving vegetation.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Flash intensity</td>
<td>A number of camera trap models allow flash intensity to be adjusted
automatically to the distance to the subject. Some models enable the
amount of light generated by the white flash to be adjusted for two to
three distance settings. However, the flash of most models is programmed
for maximum distance and illumination.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Power autonomy</td>
<td>Studies in remote areas and/or with long deployment periods require
high power autonomy. Camera traps with white flash generally consume
more battery power then those with infrared flash. The three most common
battery types used by camera traps are AA Lithium, Nickel Metal Hydride
(NiMH) and Alkaline, which are discussed in the <a href="#_Batteries">Batteries</a> section. Despite the higher initial
costs, rechargeable NiMH batteries are recommended as long as camera
trap performances are not altered. A number of camera models (e.g.
Spypoint, Bolymedia, Uway) mount an input jack for external batteries or
small solar panels so higher capacity, lead-acid batteries can be used
to prolong deployment.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Image resolution, sharpness and clarity</td>
<td>Most camera traps capture medium-to-high resolution images and
video. However, the sharpness and clarity of colour images, needed to
identify individuals and species, are also critical features. For images
captured at night, only those taken with a white Xenon flash are clear
and sharp enough to identify naturally marked individuals. Image
resolution and clarity is often critical when targeting small animals,
especially where sympatric species coexist with similar morphological
features.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Camera housing and sealing</td>
<td>Housing, camouflage and water and insect proof qualities of camera
traps is extremely important, especially where extreme weather
conditions are experienced (e.g. snow, rainfall and humidity). In
addition, ability to protect cameras with metal cases and lock them is
critical against theft and/or damage by large animals. Housing should
allow easy attachment of the unit to the support or tree used and allow
access to replace batteries and SD cards when attached to the support.
Housing should ideally have a tripod stud on the rear and underside to
attach mounting brackets.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Camera programming and setting</td>
<td>Should be as simple as possible, to allow researchers and
practitioners with varying degree of experience to set camera traps
consistently and without errors. The option of programming the operation
time, to avoid unnecessary images, may be useful for example when only
nocturnal species are targeted. Setting camera traps to take an image at
regular intervals in time (i.e. time lapse), either at pre-designated
intervals or regular intervals following a motion detection, may be
useful to decrease data load while confirming presence or examine
temporal activity of invertebrates (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2011;
Potter <em>et al.</em> 2021).</td>

<p>Cost is a key factor in determining camera trap selection. A suitable
number of units are needed for robust scientific research, and the cost
of different camera traps, as well as your budget and objectives will
influence selection. One must consider the trade-off between fewer
higher cost devices, with greater data, durability and security, and a
greater number of low-cost devices. If the features of a low-cost unit
are sufficient to meet your data objectives, this may be the best
option, particularly if you require a high number of camera traps for
robustness. The risk of theft and damage must also be considered during
camera trap selection. Widely used Reconyx camera traps (see above) have
a high cost per unit relative to most other makes. However, this is
greatly offset by their climatic durability, reliability, sensitivity
and flexible programming (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>Camera trap specifications used or recommended for various Australian
taxa (e.g. small, medium-sized and large mammals, invasive predators,
reptiles) are summarised in the <a href="#_Quick_reference_deployment">Quick reference deployment
guidelines</a>.</p>
<p><h3>Camera trap point selection and preparation</h3></p>
<p>When choosing the exact location for a camera trap, careful attention
to camera trap placement and site preparation can improve detection,
facilitate species identification and significantly reduce the incidence
of false triggers. When considering camera trap placement look for signs
of fauna (e.g. tracks, scats) and features likely to be used or visited
by fauna (e.g. animal trails, fallen logs, drainage lines, narrow
gullies, edges of dense vegetation, paths to water). Consider the target
species or suite of species and their travel habits, the likely path of
travel, the sensor’s range and field of view, and the terrain. Select
the location that is likely to detect your target species or yield the
greatest number of images of a suite of species, depending on the aims
of your project (TEAM Network 2011).</p>
<p>An ideal location is a flat or gently sloping area that is relatively
clear of shrubs and ground vegetation but is shaded by trees or rock
over-hangs. If deploying camera traps in a rocky or densely vegetated
habitat, think carefully how fauna might access the point; if access is
limited then this will influence the detection probability (Gillespie
<em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>Set the ‘stage’ for the camera trap. Occasionally, terrain or
vegetation can obstruct the detection zone. Remove vegetation as needed
(considering windy conditions), to maximise detection within the field
of view of the camera trap and to minimise false triggers. Try to keep
the stage as natural as possible, taking care not to disturb the area
too much or create obstructions of cleared vegetation (TEAM Network
2011).</p>
<p>If using bait stations or carcasses, it may be best to remove all
vegetation around them to ensure an uninterrupted view of fauna and
prevent false triggers. The vegetation around the base of the camera
trap mount, or tree to which the camera trap is attached to, should also
be reduced to minimise the risk of fire damage to camera traps
(Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p><h3>Mode of deployment</h3></p>
<p>How a camera trap is deployed in the field (i.e. its height, angle,
direction) can greatly improve detection probability and reduce false
triggers. The detection zone of the PIR sensor in most camera traps is a
wedge-shaped, horizontal band (or bands) spreading outwards from the
front of the sensor. As a result, the detection zone increases in size
with increasing distance from the sensor (see the figure below). Setting
camera traps so that the sensor is at different heights above the ground
and at different distances to the focal area allows different sized
fauna species to be targeted (see the figure below).</p>
<p>Setting camera traps close to the ground (i.e. 15–20 cm) and angled
horizontally to the ground, or higher and angled so that they point
towards the ground, will record the greatest size range of animals, as
sensors will be triggered by both smaller animals and the legs of larger
animals. The camera trap’s field of view is more expansive vertically
and generally wider than the sensor’s detection zone, so although only
the legs of an animal may trigger the sensor the photograph will contain
more of the animal. Detection zone area varies widely among camera trap
models (see Meek et al. 2012). Camera traps with a narrow detection zone
(i.e. smaller than the camera field of view) usually have fast trigger
speeds and will take the photo when the animal is well within the field
of view (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>When targeting large animals such as kangaroos, camera traps should
be set so that the sensor is at the height of the animal’s shoulder
(e.g. approximately 1 m above the ground). This will reduce the number
of images of smaller non-target species, as these animals will be
underneath the detection zone (see the figure below). A maximum distance
of 5 m between the camera trap and the focal point (e.g. a trail along
which an animal may be travelling) should allow adequate illumination
and reduce the likelihood of animals being obscured by vegetation
(Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>For medium-sized animals (e.g. quolls, bandicoots, possums), the
camera trap should be set so that the sensor is approximately 50 cm
above the ground. A distance of 3 m between the camera and the target
area (e.g. bait station) will ensure the animal is in the foreground of
the photograph and is clearly illuminated by the flash (Gillespie <em>et
al.</em> 2015). For example, for bandicoots, camera traps are deployed
approximately 50 cm above ground level in locations with evidence of
recent diggings or suitable habitat, with inaccessible bait stations
with rolled oats, honey and peanut butter (5:1:2 ratio; truffle oil
optional at 20 ml/kg) bait attractant set up 1–3 m in front of each
camera trap. Vegetation is removed to ground level between the camera
trap and bait station and within 1 m around the bait station if
necessary (DSEWPAC 2011).</p>
<p>For small mammals, studies have found that a sensor height of
approximately 20–30 cm above the ground, or downward facing camera traps
increase detection (Welbourne <em>et al.</em> 2015; Gray <em>et al.</em>
2017; Dundas <em>et al.</em> 2019; Seidlitz <em>et al.</em> 2021). When
targeting small mammals set the remote camera close to the target area
(e.g. 1.5 m between the camera and bait station). Although small mammals
are detected by remote cameras targeting medium-sized mammals, setting
the camera close to the target area will capture the fine detail
required for identifying certain small mammal species (Gillespie <em>et
al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>Tracks and roads have been shown to facilitate movement of introduced
predators such as feral cats and foxes (Carter <em>et al.</em> 2012),
and consequently, placing camera traps along them will increase the
probability of detection (Meek 2018). Indeed, on-road detectability
using camera traps was estimated to be seven times higher for cats and
three times higher for foxes than off-road detectability. Furthermore,
targeting camera trap survey effort on-road yielded the greatest power
for detecting declines in both species (Geyle <em>et al.</em> 2020),
which is useful for monitoring the success of lethal baiting programs.
For feral cats, foxes and wild dogs, camera traps should be placed 30 cm
from a road or track edge, 50 cm above the ground, set parallel to the
ground (although this may vary depending on topography), oriented 23° to
the road or track and facing away from the sun’s path (facing south and
in shade is optimal). The detection point should be 4–6 m from the
camera trap in the middle of the road or track. Rock outcrops,
reflective surfaces and shadows in the field of view should be avoided,
as well as vegetation close enough that it can blow into the field of
view (Meek 2018).</p>
<p>Setting camera traps to optimise detection of a wide range of species
requires a balanced approach; there is no one size fits all. One option
is to maximise the sensor sensitivity and the picture frame; set the
camera up so that it is angled down towards a feature or bait station
such that the field of view covers an area of ground from the foreground
of the feature or bait station within 1.5 m of the camera trap to
several metres beyond the feature or bait station. For single camera
trap deployments, the bait station to camera distance should be 2.5 m.
However, by deploying multiple cameras at a site, variable setups can
also be incorporated, such as varying the bait station distance from 1.5
– 2.5 m (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>The majority of camera traps work by sensing objects that move and
are a different temperature relative to the background surface and
objects. They are therefore most suited to detecting mammals and to a
lesser extent birds (i.e. endotherms; TEAM Network 2011; Cloyed <em>et
al.</em> 2018), but are generally less sensitive at detecting reptiles
and amphibians (i.e. ectotherms; Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
However, camera traps positioned facing downwards have successfully
monitored reptiles using bait stations to attract species to the
detection zone, drift fences to direct species towards the detection
zone, and cork tiles to create a sufficient thermal contrast between the
tile, which is heated by the sun, and the species (Welbourne <em>et
al.</em> 2015; Moore <em>et al.</em> 2020a). More recently, this
approach was refined by reducing the focal length of Reconxy camera
traps to avoid blurry images for when they are angled vertically towards
the ground, 70 cm above the ground. This allowed small, similar looking
sympatric species to be differentiated (Welbourne <em>et al.</em> 2019).
Reconyx can alter the focal length of their professional series of
camera traps at the time of purchase, but it is also possible for
practitioners to adjust this themselves, as demonstrated by Welbourne
<em>et al.</em> (2019).</p>
<p>For amphibians, camera traps deployed close to and focused on
microhabitats have been successfully used to monitor movements, activity
patterns and behaviour when capturing time lapse images (Hoffman <em>et
al.</em> 2010; Pagnucco <em>et al.</em> 2011; Engbrecht and Lannoo 2012;
Barata <em>et al.</em> 2018). Similarly, camera traps deployed 50 cm
above the ground and angled at 45° and vertically towards the ground
have been successful at detecting invertebrates when capturing time
lapse images (Potter <em>et al.</em> 2021).</p>
<p>Camera traps should be orientated facing south to prevent false
triggers from sun glare and shadowing, and minimise sun damage to the
camera lens and sensor. If using a tree to mount a camera trap, select a
solid tree that will not move in the wind (diameter greater than 20 cm),
with a relatively straight trunk and with a clear area to the south to
direct the camera trap (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>

(e.g. small, medium-sized and large mammals, invasive predators,
reptiles) are summarised in the <a href="#_Quick_reference_deployment">Quick reference deployment

<p>Detection of different sized fauna from camera traps mounted at
different heights (adapted from Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p><h3>Camera trap settings</h3></p>
<p>Three adjustable settings are common to many camera traps that can be
used to ensure animals are captured, false triggers are minimised, and
camera traps remain operational for the duration of a deployment: (i)
motion sensor sensitivity; (ii) activation time; and (iii) camera delay
(Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>Adjusting the sensitivity of the PIR sensor changes the heat
sensitivity threshold, either being more or less responsive to the
temperature differential between an animal and the background
environment required to trigger the camera. As this heat difference is
larger in cold temperatures, PIR sensors are more sensitive in temperate
environments or during cooler seasons. High sensitivity is typically
better to detect small-sized mammals. Lowering the sensitivity may
reduce false triggers. However, by reducing the sensitivity there is a
risk that some animals may not trigger the camera, especially in warm
environments (e.g. many parts of northern Australia), where there is
less difference between an animal’s body temperature and that of its
surroundings. For cameras with SD cards that have the capacity to retain
large numbers of images on a single set of batteries, large numbers of
false triggers are less problematic and the maximum sensitivity setting
is recommended to avoid missing animals (Gillespie <em>et al.</em>
2015). However, the data storage and processing implications of this
need to be considered.</p>
<p>Activation time settings allow camera traps to be set to operate
continuously, only at night, or only during the day. Some camera traps
can also be programmed to operate between particular times (e.g.
0500–0800 hours). When targeting species that are strictly nocturnal,
setting the camera trap for night operation only will eliminate many
false trigger events during the day and reduce the number of images of
non-target species. Reliable knowledge of the activity patterns of the
target species aid in determining whether this is an appropriate setting
for nocturnal animals that may also be active at dawn and dusk
(Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>Many camera traps include a feature that allows for a pause (e.g. 15,
30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes) between successive triggers, which is
important for determining the independence of captures. This will reduce
the number of photographs taken of the same animal (e.g. if animals
linger for long periods at bait stations), and may be useful in areas
where there are very high levels of animal activity, especially of
non-target species (e.g. where macropods are common). The appropriate
length of the delay will depend largely on the target species; a minimal
delay will maximise the chances of obtaining multiple photographs of
rare or cryptic species, or group with distinctive marking (e.g. goats),
which can help to determine the size of group. A longer delay would be
appropriate when targeting slower moving animals (Gillespie <em>et
al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>Trigger speed (i.e. the speed with which a camera trap captures an
image relative to when the sensor detects the animal) can be adjusted in
some camera trap models. If available, this function can be useful for
optimising detection of different species that may move through the
field of view at different speeds, without the need for purchasing
different camera trap models with different trigger speeds. Multiple
trigger options in some camera traps, such as Reconyx, allow programming
of camera traps to capture several images in quick succession each time
the camera trap is triggered. This capability increases the likelihood
of multiple images of the same animal, aiding in accurate species
identification. The flash range is adjustable in some camera traps via
the shutter speed setting (e.g. Reconyx). A slow shutter increases the
flash range but also increases the potential for a blurry image. A fast
shutter reduces flash range but results in a cleaner image. For smaller
and faster moving animals, a faster shutter is recommended (Gillespie
<em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>Time lapse settings allow programming the camera trap to take photos
at predetermined time intervals, without being triggered. This function
may be useful for recording the presence of species that do not readily
trigger infra-red sensors, such as amphibians and invertebrates (Hoffman
<em>et al.</em> 2010; Pagnucco <em>et al.</em> 2011; Engbrecht and
Lannoo 2012; Barata <em>et al.</em> 2018; Potter <em>et al.</em> 2021),
or for monitoring ecological processes, such as plant phenology (Kim
<em>et al.</em> 2021). For amphibians, camera traps set to capture time
lapse images, or a combination of sensor triggered and time lapse images
have been successfully used to monitor movements (Pagnucco <em>et
al.</em> 2011), and describe activity patterns and behaviour (Hoffman
<em>et al.</em> 2010; Engbrecht and Lannoo 2012), including for a rare
and elusive micro-endemic frog species strictly dependent on bromeliads
(Barata <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>
<p>Most camera traps can be set to capture video when they are
triggered, which may be useful in behavioural studies (Hoffman <em>et
al.</em> 2010; Krauss <em>et al.</em> 2018), distinguishing sympatric
species (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017), or individual identification in
mark-recapture studies (Mattioli <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>

(e.g. small, medium-sized and large mammals, invasive predators,
reptiles) are summarised in the <a href="#_Quick_reference_deployment">Quick reference deployment
guidelines</a>.</p>
<p><h3>Lures</h3></p>
<p>Camera trap surveys often use lures to attract fauna into the
detection zone of camera traps, thereby maximising the likelihood of
detection. This is particularly important when targeting wide ranging
species that occur at low densities and species that do not use
predictable travel routes or habitats where camera traps can be
deployed. Without the attractive effects of a lure, the likelihood that
such species will happen to pass by the camera trap and be detected may
be very low (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>Lures can be edible (i.e. baits, which may also have an attractive
scent), olfactory (i.e. scent), auditory (i.e. sound) or visual. Common
lures used to attract vertebrate pest species such as foxes and feral
cats include fresh and dried meat baits, auditory lures (e.g. Feline
Audio Phonic, Westcare Industries, Perth, WA, Australia), and scent
lures (e.g. fox urine; Catastrophic, a proprietary product developed by
Outfoxed Pest Control, Melbourne, VIC, Australia) (Stokeld <em>et
al.</em> 2015). Visual lures, such as flashing lights and shiny compact
disks, which can be used to appeal to the hunting instincts of predators
and increase visitation to bait stations, are often used in association
with other types of lures (Bengsen <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>
<p>When using baits, the choice of bait depends on the food preferences
of the species being targeted. When targeting carnivores, meat baits
have generally been used in Australia, including chunks of raw chicken,
kangaroo, rabbit or fish (e.g. pilchards, tuna log, perforated tins of
cat food) and fish oil. However, meat and fish can putrefy very quickly,
which may in fact act as a deterrent to some species. A standard mammal
trapping bait mix of peanut butter, rolled oats and honey has been
successfully used in surveys targeting a wide variety of small- and
medium-sized native mammals, such as quolls, bandicoots, possums and
rodents (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). A number of manufactured,
lethal baits are commercially available for vertebrate pest management
(e.g. FOXOFF®, FOXECUTE®, DOGABAIT®, CUROSITY®, Animal Control
Technologies (Australia), Somerton, VIC, Australia), and these may serve
as lures for camera trap studies targeting these species.</p>
<p>Placing baits and olfactory lures inside containers that allow
airflow (e.g. small cages, tea infusers, perforated PVC pipes) suspended
above the ground will protect them from removal by target and non-target
species, and ensure that their attractiveness persists for as long as
possible. Species including corvids, rodents, dingoes, and ants can
interfere severely with baits. Attaching the bait container to a pole
(e.g. star dropper, wooden stake) secures it and provides greater
flexibility in positioning of the bait in relation to the camera trap.
Ants can be deterred by spreading dust or granular insecticide for ants
around the base of the pole (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>The Department of Environment, Parks and Water Security (Northern
Territory Government) has devised a bait container that is suitable for
most baits and deployments and can be quickly constructed from readily
available materials. The bait container is constructed using a short (80
mm) length of 50 mm PVC pipe with a wire-mesh ventilated end cap, an
overhanging cover on the top and slit-ventilated bottom cap. The
plumbing descriptions for the end caps are ‘vent water/insect proof PVC
50 mm’ for the top and ‘vent insect proof PVC 50 mm’ for the bottom
(Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>The aims of your study need to be carefully considered when deciding
if lures will be used to attract fauna to camera traps. Detection rates
and the species detected can vary considerably between camera traps
deployed with and without lures. The use of lures may cause differential
behavioural responses of individuals within and between species. Some
individuals or species may become ‘trap happy’, while others may avoid
the camera traps. This can be problematic if accurate or representative
population demographic (assumes equal detectability) or spatial and
temporal habitat use information is required (Meek <em>et al.</em>
2014a). A decision key to help you determine whether or not lures are
suitable to use for your project is provided in the figure below.</p>
<p>Where lures are used, sufficient detail of the type of lure (edible,
olfactory, audio, visual), variety of lure, how far and at what height
the lure is placed from the camera trap, if and how the lure is
protected from consumption or removal by target and non-target animals,
and how long the lure is deployed for must be recorded (Meek <em>et
al.</em> 2014a).</p>

<p><span class="anchor" id="_Number_and_density"></span><h3>Carcasses</h3></p>
<p>Carrion, or decaying animal flesh, is a key component and driver of
ecosystem structure and functioning that supports a range of vertebrate,
invertebrate and microbial species. Considering vertebrate species, many
that scavenge animal remains also function as predators. Therefore,
carcasses that attract scavengers may increase the predation risk to
local fauna communities in proximity to the carcasses, particularly in
environments of low productivity, where human activity increases carcass
provision (e.g. culling), and if the scavengers are invasive predators
(Spencer <em>et al.</em> 2021).</p>
<p>Camera traps can be used to monitor carcasses for a number of
reasons. These include determining how carcasses affect overall and
predator-specific nest predation (Spencer <em>et al.</em> 2021),
improving understanding of wild dog scavenging ecology (Spencer and
Newsome 2021), testing the direct and indirect effects of carcass
subsidies from simulated culls (Rees <em>et al.</em> 2020), and
investigating scavenger utilisation of hunter-shot deer and stranded
marine fauna (Forsyth <em>et al.</em> 2014; Behrendorff <em>et al.</em>
2018).</p>
<p>If carcasses are required for your camera trapping study they can be
sourced from management culls, hunting kills or road kills.
Alternatively, a camera trap may be placed at a carcass encountered in
your study area (Behrendorff <em>et al.</em> 2018). If obtaining and
placing carcasses, camera trap points should be spaced at distances
sufficient to minimise carcass scent traveling between points, such that
scavengers would have to actively forage and seek out carcasses rather
than being able to move quickly from one camera trap point to another. A
minimum distance of 1 km has been used in recent studies in Australia.
The carcasses, in particular smaller carcasses, should be secured to the
ground so they cannot be removed out of the camera trap’s field of view
(Spencer <em>et al.</em> 2021). When all edible soft tissue has been
removed from a carcass and it has been reduced to skeletal remains,
camera traps should be removed, or the carcass replaced, as the carcass
loses its attraction to scavengers (Behrendorff <em>et al.</em> 2018;
Spencer and Newsome 2021). The indirect impact of carcass provision on
native species must be considered before use (Spencer <em>et al.</em>
2021).</p>
<p><h3>Monitoring herbivory of palatable plants</h3></p>
<p>Camera traps can be focused on palatable plants to monitor browse
species and their impacts, including both native fauna and introduced
pests. It is important determine the most palatable plant species and
the preferential foraging behaviour of target species within the study
area. These two factors often align and the most palatable species is
also the most noticeably browsed species or the species lacking juvenile
cohorts (McDonald and Brandle 2009; Mutze <em>et al.</em> 2016b).</p>
<p>Selecting a palatable plant species as a feature to focus a camera
trap on depends on the target browse species. For example, feral rabbits
prefer palatable, short-lived species such as acacias and casuarinas as
opposed to less palatable, long-lived eucalypts (Cooke and McPhee 2007),
and feral deer prefer species with lower leaf-fibre content in temperate
forests and species with a greater specific leaf area in grasslands
(Forsyth <em>et al.</em> 2005; Lloyd <em>et al.</em> 2010). Feral goats
are less selective, based on adaptations that neutralise tannins and
their ability to stand on their hind legs (McDonald and Brandle 2009),
and often prefer the most prevalent species in the landscape (Raufirad
<em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>
<p>Camera traps should be positioned based on the height of the target
browse species (e.g. feral rabbits browse up to approximately 40 cm),
and can be arranged to maximise visual coverage of potential foraging
areas (e.g. paired camera traps at each camera trap point; Reid <em>et
al.</em> 2020). The level of site preparation to reduce false triggers
needs to be balanced with limiting disturbance to the potential foraging
area. Where long grass is present, a simple solution is to place the
camera trap at least 1 m above the ground to prevent false triggers
(Reid <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>
<p><h3>Number and density of camera trap points</h3></p>
<p>The number of camera trap points, whether single or multiple camera
traps are allocated per point, the distance between camera traps, the
spatial coverage of a camera trap, and the total survey area are all
important considerations for camera trapping studies. An adequate number
of camera trap points is required to ensure the sampling effort can
reliably detect an effect relative to the total survey area. When
determining this number, the desired levels of accuracy and precision
must be considered comparative to other influential factors, such as the
increasing cost of deployment with each camera trap and the
heterogeneity of the study area (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a). The table
below outlines a rudimentary guide to the minimum number of camera trap
points with a single camera trap for occupancy surveys based on how
common or rare and detectable a species is (Gillespie <em>et al.</em>
2015).</p>
<p>The daily detection probability of the camera traps and the number of
repeat surveys that are carried out at each camera trap point (i.e. the
number of camera trap nights) should also be considered when determining
the number of camera trap points. In general, surveying more camera trap
points a greater number of times using the camera trap settings and
deployment mode with the highest probability of detection, will maximise
the precision of the estimate of the rate of occupancy. However, there
are usually conflicts and trade-offs between these three aims. For
example, if limited numbers of camera traps are available for use on a
particular project, then carrying out many days of survey at each camera
trap point will limit the total number of points that can be surveyed
over the course of a survey season. The expected precision associated
with a particular sampling program can be calculated if reasonable
estimates regarding the occupancy rate amongst the sampled camera trap
points and probability of detection are available prior to the survey.
This information may be available from a previous study of the same
species, from pilot studies, or from expert opinion (Gillespie <em>et
al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>The distance between camera trap points, or camera trap spacing, will
vary depending on the ecology of the target species and needs to be
scaled accordingly to ensure independence of observations at adjacent
camera trap points. The home ranges of target species should be
considered and reported. More widely spaced camera traps will be
appropriate for wide-ranging animals with large home ranges, while
closer spacing is generally more suitable for species with smaller home
ranges (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Where camera trap points are in
a regular grid or transect, distance between cameras can be recorded as
a single value. However, where camera trap points are randomly or
irregularly located, as in the targeted protocol, the average, minimum
and maximum distance among the points along with a measure of the
distribution of distances (e.g. standard deviation) should be recorded.
The survey area can be defined by calculating the areas enclosed by
either the concave or convex perimeter of camera trap points (Meek
<em>et al.</em> 2014a).</p>
<p>Where multiple species are being surveyed, detection bias needs to be
considered as it is difficult to achieve an optimal camera trap spacing
for a suite of species, and you are likely to end up with increased
detection probability for some species and decreased detection
probability for others (Harmsen <em>et al.</em> 2010; Foster and Harmsen
2012; Mann <em>et al.</em> 2015). Studies assessing the species richness
of terrestrial mammals vary considerably in camera trap spacing,
including &lt;1 km (Trolle and Kéry 2005; Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em>
2014; Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018), 1 km (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018),
1.5 km (Silveira <em>et al.</em> 2003), 2 km (Tobler <em>et al.</em>
2008; Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018) and varied spacing between 1.75 and
&gt;5 km within the same study area (Srbek-Araujo and Chiarello 2013).
Arrays of 20–30 camera traps at a density of one camera trap per 2
km<sup>2</sup> are used to monitor changes in the community of
ground-dwelling, terrestrial vertebrates in tropical regions (TEAM
Network 2011), whereas a robust predator monitoring program will often
have at least 20–30 camera traps spaced approximately 1 km apart (Meek
2018).</p>
<p>Deploying more than one camera trap at each sampling location is
expected to lead to an increase in the probability of detecting a
species (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Deploying multiple camera
traps per point in an array may also be useful to determine occupancy,
detectability and power to monitor population change of species among
micro-habitats (e.g. monitoring feral cats and foxes on- and off-road;
Geyle <em>et al.</em> 2020), or to assess the influence of camera trap
placement relative to a grid point based on the number and type of
animal signs (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>
<p>Camera trap numbers and densities used or recommended for various
Australian taxa (e.g. small, medium-sized and large mammals, invasive
predators, reptiles) are summarised in the <a href="#_Quick_reference_deployment">Quick reference deployment

<p><h3>Camera trap arrays</h3></p>
<p>If you wish to undertake a general survey of the fauna across a
project or study area without altering the behaviour of that fauna,
deploying camera traps in a grid array is the most effective approach.
Grid arrays can be used to sample a broad area simultaneously and
uniformly, which provides a suitable sample size and enables an accurate
indication of species abundance over the whole survey area. For this
reason, an indicated absence (where a species is not detected) from a
grid array sample is likely to reflect a true absence (where a species
is not present). If resources are limited, establishing a transect
through the most representative part of the survey area and placing
camera traps at pre-determined intervals along that transect, might be
the best approach. However, indicated absences obtained from transect
samples cannot be reliably used as an indication of true absence. It is
possible to combine grid and transect array approaches (Molloy 2018).
For example, sampling transects along a network of roads and tracks
across a study area.</p>
<p>If planning to deploy camera traps in an array, it is important to
review ecological information for the target species, suite of species,
or community to inform the number, spacing and shape of the camera trap
array (see <a href="#_Number_and_density">Number and density of
cameras</a> above and the table below). Satellite imagery and GIS
spatial data layers (e.g. vegetation mapping, access tracks, soil,
landform, watercourses, land-use), along with any other information
relevant to the project, are also critical to establish and
geo-reference the array (see the figure below). Factors such as poor
accessibility (e.g. few tracks, difficult terrain, dense vegetation) can
limit the camera trap array design. Decisions on the camera trap array
should be based on the best available biological and geographical
information (see the table below). Consider the need to minimise
disturbance of the project area associated with accessing each camera
trap point. Identify existing tracks and trails, as well as passages
that may be suitable for temporary access routes. Consider if temporary
access routes are required to undertake other modules and if these can
be combined with camera trap array temporary access routes. Identify
areas not suitable for inclusion in the camera trap array, such as rocky
outcrops (by interpreting satellite imagery), steep slopes that would
prohibit traversing or sampling (using a digital elevation model), and
open areas or large gaps (e.g. cleared areas; by interpreting satellite
imagery).</p>
<p>Broad-scale locations of camera trap points (e.g. 1 km spacing) are
generally established and geo-referenced through the desktop assessment
process. Fine-scale camera trap locations, within close proximity (e.g.
20 m) to the broad-scale locations, are then determined in the field
based on suitable camera trap placement locations to maximise detection
of the target fauna. If there is a major altitudinal gradient within the
project area or study area, you may consider generating multiple camera
trapping grids or transects along this gradient (e.g. in three strata:
low elevation, mid elevation and high elevation).</p>
<p>Useful GIS spatial data layers are provided in table below. The
<em>Terrestrial Vertebrate (formerly Camera Trap) Monitoring
Protocol</em> provides useful information to undertake camera trapping
using a grid array (TEAM Network 2011). The protocol was developed from
the collective experience of many field biologists with experience using
camera trap arrays to estimate the abundance of a range of terrestrial
mammal and bird species, with the sampling design carefully specified to
maximise the probability of detecting an adequate sample species that
range over large (&gt;100 km<sup>2</sup>) and small (~1 km<sup>2</sup>)
home ranges. For camera trapping using transect arrays, the <em>Guide
for camera trapping wild dogs, foxes and feral cats</em> provides useful
information (Meek 2018).</p>

<p><h3>Deployment period</h3></p>
<p>The period of time in which camera traps are deployed determines how
many daily replicate samples are collected (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a),
with datasets generally improving the longer the deployment period (Kays
et al 2009). This variable has been found to be a more important factor
than camera trap spacing and microsite placement at grid points in
providing accurate species richness estimates (Colyn <em>et al.</em>
2018). Ultimately, the optimal deployment period will depend on your
target species, meaning further research should be undertaken to
adequately prepare for your survey (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012b).</p>
<p>A common camera trap deployment period is 2–4 weeks (Kays <em>et
al.</em> 2011). However, how common or rare a species is in the
landscape and the detection probability will affect decisions around the
deployment period of camera traps (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). In
some cases, including where the number of camera trap points sampled is
more important for analysis than deployment period (Kays <em>et al.</em>
2011), or during a pilot study to confirm that traps can adequately
detect certain species and allow accurate identification (Meek and
Vernes 2015), camera traps may be deployed for less than 2 weeks.
However, the minimum recommended deployment period of camera traps to
monitor small- and medium-sized mammals in Australia is 14 nights (Paull
<em>et al.</em> 2011). A deployment period of 30 nights for each of
20–30 camera traps is used to monitor changes in the community of
ground-dwelling, terrestrial vertebrates in tropical regions (TEAM
Network 2011). Similarly, camera traps are recommended to be deployed
for a minimum period of four weeks for each of 20–30 camera traps used
to monitor predators (Meek 2018).</p>
<p>The table in the <a href="#_Number_and_density">Number and density of
camera trap points</a> section outlines a rudimentary guide to the
minimum number of weeks to deploy camera traps for occupancy surveys
based on how common or rare and detectable a species is (Gillespie
<em>et al.</em> 2015). Whereas the table below outlines the estimated
deployment periods required to achieve a detection probability &gt;0.7
for feral cats using 2–5 camera traps placed in and around a 50 x 50 m
Fauna Plot. At each plot, five camera traps were deployed in a diamond
configuration, with a single camera trap in the centre and four camera
traps placed 30–100 m from the centre point (Stokeld <em>et al.</em>
2015).</p>
<p>The maximum camera trap deployment period is also usually limited by
battery life or the storage capacity of SD cards. If camera traps are
not required for use at other camera trap points, then deploying camera
traps for a length of time close to the expected endurance of the
batteries and/or SD card storage capacity is a good strategy. This is
because the cost of leaving a deployed camera trap out for a few extra
days is effectively zero – no additional staff time or resources are
required for a 30-day deployment for example, compared to a 10-day
deployment. By maximising the length of the deployments, a greater
effective number of daily replicate samples are collected at each camera
trap point, and hence a longer sequence of detection and non-detection
events are accumulated. Statistically, this leads to a more precise
estimation of both the probability of detection and the rate of
occupancy. Occupancy estimates can also be improved by increasing the
number of locations surveyed (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>Deployment periods used or recommended for various Australian taxa
(e.g. small, medium-sized and large mammals, invasive predators,
reptiles) are summarised in the <a href="#_Quick_reference_deployment">Quick reference deployment
guidelines</a>.</p>

<p><h3>SD cards</h3></p>
<p>A Secure Digital<sup>®</sup> (SD) card is required to store the
images and videos captured by a camera trap. SD cards have various
storage capacities and reading and writing speeds. Larger capacity cards
can store more images and videos. Several factors will influence your
required storage capacity, including deployment period, target species,
site conditions, selected image quality and whether you are capturing
video. Most users find that 4GB or 8GB cards are more than adequate for
general use, with capacity to store between approximately 4,000 and
8,000 3.1MP images, respectively. You may want to consider a larger
storage capacity if camera traps are being deployed for a long period,
the risk of false triggers is high, or you are capturing video. Ensure
you check the maximum capacity SD card that your camera traps will
accept.</p>
<p>SD cards with higher speed ratings are capable of reading and writing
images faster, which is particularly advantageous when capturing
RapidFire image sequences. Speed Class 10 SD cards, which are capable of
high reading and writing speeds with a minimum write speed of 10MB/s,
are recommend. It is also recommended that you purchase two SD cards per
camera trap, so they can be easily swapped when redeploying camera
traps.</p>
<p><h3>Batteries</h3></p>
<p>Each camera trap can require up to 12 AA batteries depending on the
make and model. Batteries should be selected after consulting the user
manual of the camera traps you are using and consideration of your study
requirements. The three most common battery types used are Nickel-Metal
Hydride (NiMH), lithium and alkaline. Longer lasting batteries such as
rechargeable NiMH and lithium batteries are preferred over alkaline
batteries (TEAM Network 2011), which tend to discharge quicker and also
suffer in extreme cold weather (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012b).</p>
<p>Rechargeable and lithium batteries have similar upfront costs
(excluding chargers). However, rechargeable batteries are a better
long-term option and recommended for their reliability, longevity, and
sustainability. In Australia, Eneloop and Eneloop Pro batteries are high
quality and have been recommended by experts (Meek <em>et al.</em>
2012b). It is common practice to have two complete sets of rechargeable
batteries per camera trap, which enables the seamless redeployment of
camera traps within and between studies. Instructions for preparing
rechargeable batteries for the field are outlined <a href="#camera-trap-deployment-protocol">Pre-field survey tasks</a> (TEAM
Network 2011).</p>
<p><h3>Storage and transport</h3></p>
<p>Camera traps should be stored in a safe location and transported in
sealed, padded containers to prevent accidental damage, water damage,
dust damage and theft (Gillespie et al. 2015). Do not store or carry
camera traps with food or any other substances that can leave an odour,
as this might attract fauna to the camera trap in the field, biasing the
estimates of detection probability. An open backpack frame to which the
camera traps can be strapped is a practical solution to carry camera
traps in the field (TEAM Network 2011).</p>
<p><h3>Permits and ethics</h3></p>
<p>A key feature of camera traps, in contrast to many other wildlife
survey techniques, is that they are relatively non-invasive; animals
don’t need to be physically captured or handled as part of the survey.
From an ethical and animal welfare point of view, camera traps are only
minimally intrusive, with impacts on animals limited to minor
disturbance caused by flashes and camera noise, and behavioural
responses to baits and minor habitat disturbance. For these reasons,
animal ethics approvals may still be required for implementing camera
trap surveys (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>You should contact the relevant animal ethics committee to ensure you
have the required animal ethics approvals well in advance of your field
survey. You will need to consider how often the animal ethics committee
meets and the timeframe for approvals to be granted. It is also wise to
allow time to address any queries from the committee or conditions that
must be met prior to an approval being granted.</p>

(<a href="appendix_deployment">Appendix 1</a>) to install batteries, SD cards and desiccant packets (for
humid/wet conditions), and configure the settings for each camera trap
before continuing.</p></li>
<li><p>If deploying camera traps in an array, ensure the proposed array
has been uploaded to your device (csv file with ‘Name’, ‘Latitude’ and
‘Longitude’ columns, with latitude and longitude in decimal degrees; see
<a href="appendix_deployment">Appendix 1</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>If deploying camera traps within a Fauna Plot, ensure the Plot
Selection and Layout Module has been completed to establish the Fauna
Plot and mark out the plot boundaries and trapping configuration,
including the camera trap points.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the Camera Trapping Module in the Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>Select Camera Trap Deployment.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>survey type</em> from the following drop-down list
(you can only complete one type of survey at a time):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Camera trap point</p></li>
<li><p>Camera trap array – grid</p></li>
<li><p>Camera trap array – transect</p></li>
<li><p>Fauna plot.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Record a <em>survey label</em>. This is a descriptor to
distinguish the camera trap deployment for subsequent re-equipping and
retrieval (e.g. June 30 array deployment).</p></li>
<li><p>Traverse your project area and locate a proposed camera trap
point, whether at a feature of interest, as part of an array or within a
Fauna Plot. Approach it with the required equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>add camera trap point</em> button. The app will
automatically record a <em>deployment ID</em> (sequential number from 1,
assigned to the project and current survey) and bring up the required
data fields.</p></li>
<li><p>If a camera trap array option is selected, the app will prompt
you to record the <em>distance to closest camera trap point</em> in
metres (m). The initial entry will be automatically populated for
subsequent deployments, and can be updated if the minimum distance
between points changes.</p></li>
<li><p>If the camera trap array – transect option is selected, the app
will prompt you to record the <em>transect number</em>. This will be
automatically set to ‘1’. However, you can update this if you are
deploying camera traps along multiple transects.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Fauna Plot option is selected, the app will prompt you to
select which <em>Fauna Plot</em> you are surveying in from a drop-down
list of established Fauna Plots.</p></li>
<li><p>Record a <em>camera trap point ID</em> that is suitable for your
project (e.g. CTP001). Consider if you are planning to deploy a paired
camera trap nearby (e.g. CTP001A and CTP001B).</p></li>
<li><p>If targeting a specific taxa or species, record the <em>target
taxa</em> and <em>target species</em> from the drop-down lists. Multiple
taxa and/or species can be added.</p></li>
<li><p>Scan the immediate area to ensure it is suitable to secure a
camera trap mounting post with the focal point in a southerly direction.
If it is not suitable to secure a mounting post or there are issues with
the detection zone and field of view, move to the nearest suitable
area.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a steel post driver or mash hammer to secure a camera trap
mounting post into the ground in a northerly direction from your desired
focal point. Ensure the post remains tall enough so the top of the
mounted camera trap is a suitable height for your project needs. If
there is a large tree trunk or stem in a suitable position this can be
used. Ensure the post is secure or the tree trunk or stem is large
enough to prevent false triggers from camera movement. Record the
<em>camera trap mount</em> from the drop-down list (e.g. ‘Star dropper’,
‘Tree’).</p></li>
<li><p>When standing directly at the camera trap mounting post, press
the <em>record camera trap point location</em> button.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>feature</em> that will be the focal point of the
camera trap from the drop-down list or manual entry (e.g. trail,
waterpoint, bait station, carcass, palatable plant). If relevant, record
the <em>carcass species</em>, <em>plant species</em> or <em>sign
species</em>. Record the <em>distance to feature</em> in metres (m), a
<em>feature photo</em> and any <em>feature comments</em>. Multiple
features can be recorded (e.g. trail and bait station).</p></li>
<li><p>If using a bait station, install this first so you have a focal
point when setting up the camera trap. Use a steel post driver or mash
hammer to secure a mounting post into the ground. Ensure the post
remains tall enough so the bait container is a suitable height above the
ground for your project needs. Ensure the post is secure enough that it
cannot be easily removed by animals. Record the <em>bait station
mount</em>. If using a bait, place the bait in the bait container and
secure to the post using a mounting apparatus. If using an olfactory
lure, place the required amount inside a small container and carefully
place this into the mounted bait container. If using an audio or visual
lure, secure it to the post using a mounting apparatus. Record the
<em>lure height</em> in centimetres (cm), <em>lure type</em> and
<em>lure variety</em> used from the drop-down list or manual entry.
Where ants may be a problem, spread dust or granular insecticide for
ants around the base of the bait station.</p></li>
<li><p>If using a carcass, install this first so you have a focal point
when setting up the camera trap. Use a mash hammer to secure the two
metal stakes to the ground. Do this at a distance that will allow you to
secure the carcass to the stakes using wire around the neck and hind
achilles tendon.</p></li>
<li><p>If required for your project, install drift fences to direct
species towards the detection zone, and/or cork tiles to create a
sufficient thermal contrast between the tile, which is heated by the
sun, and the species.</p></li>
<li><p>Before mounting the camera trap, open the housing and check and
record the <em>camera trap number</em> and <em>SD card
number</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the camera trap information, including <em>make</em>,
<em>model</em>, <em>manufacture year</em> (same model may vary between
years), <em>illumination</em>, <em>activation mechanism</em> (e.g.
‘PIR’) and <em>trigger speed</em> in seconds. Once the data is entered
for the first camera trap you configure, your previous selections will
automatically appear for each subsequent camera trap you deploy during
the current survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch the camera trap on and navigate to the settings menu to
check that the following camera trap settings have been configured to
suit your project, recording each in the app as you progress:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>media type</em> (i.e. image and/or video)</p></li>
<li><p><em>images per trigger</em> (for images)</p></li>
<li><p><em>image interval</em> in seconds (for images)</p></li>
<li><p><em>video length</em> in minutes and seconds (for

<li><p><em>night mode shutter speed</em> in seconds</p></li>
<li><p><em>time format</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>date</em> and <em>time</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>unit of temperature</em></p></li>

<li><p><em>time lapse interval</em> in minutes and seconds (if time
lapse turned on)</p></li>
<li><p><em>time lapse schedule</em> (if time lapse turned on; multiple
can be recorded).</p>
<p>The app will only display the fields relevant to the <em>media
type</em> selected. Once the data is entered for the first camera trap
you configure, your previous selections will automatically appear for
each subsequent camera trap you deploy during the current survey. If you
wish to retain the same settings, you will just need to update the
<em>camera trap number</em> and <em>SD card number</em> in the app, and
<em>user label</em> in the camera trap and in the app. Close the camera
trap housing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Using a mounting apparatus and anti-theft devices if necessary,
mount the camera trap so that it is at a height to suit your project
needs and facing the focal point. It should be facing south wherever
possible (otherwise in a southerly direction). Use chocks to angle the
camera so it captures the feature in the middle of the field of view. If
required for your project, use an angle bracket to orientate the camera
trap horizontally (i.e. downward-facing detection zone and field of
view).</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>camera trap height</em> in centimetres (cm), from
the surface of the ground to the camera lens.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>camera trap angle from vertical</em> (0–90°). If
using an angle bracket to orientate the camera trap horizontally, record
the angle as ‘90°’.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>camera trap direction</em> relative to north
(0–360°) and the <em>detection angle</em> (°) relative to the predicted
path of the target taxa/species.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>slope</em> and <em>aspect</em>. If the area is
flat, record ‘0°’ for both. See the guidelines for setting camera traps
on sloped ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the sensor screen and camera lens are clean.</p></li>
<li><p>Check that there are no obstacles in front of the sensor, flash
unit or camera lens (e.g. branches, mounting straps, flagging
tape).</p></li>
<li><p>If required, undertake site preparation to prevent false
triggers, maximise species identification and reduce fire risk to
equipment. Clear all vegetation (low hanging vegetation, grass, sticks,
leaves, etc.) between the camera trap and feature. Clear vegetation at
least 1 m behind the feature and at least 1 m around the camera trap (to
mitigate fire damage). Consider the field of view of the sensor and
clear vegetation at least 1.5 m either side of the feature.</p></li>
<li><p>Record a <em>camera trap photo</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Test if the camera trap is positioned correctly using one of the
following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Walk test (if available):</strong> open the camera trap.
Switch it on and navigate to the <em>walk test</em> function. Close the
camera trap. Test the field of view by moving your hand around the focal
point while watching for the red light on the camera trap to indicate
when are within the field of view. Adjust the camera trap and repeat the
exercise as necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trigger the camera trap:</strong> open the camera trap.
Switch it on and arm the camera trap. Close the camera trap. Trigger the
camera trap by moving your hand around the focal point. If you can
review the test images on your camera trap do so. If not, switch off the
camera trap, remove the SD card and view the images using a hand-held
digital camera, SD card image viewer or on your device using an SD card
reader. Adjust the camera trap and repeat the exercise as necessary.
Delete the images before arming the camera trap.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Switch on and arm the camera trap. Close the camera trap ensuring
the rubber seal is clean and waterproof.</p></li>
<li><p>Position yourself or arm or leg in the detection zone to trigger
a capture sequence, which is used to indicate the start of the sampling
period.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>habitat</em> and <em>microhabitat</em>
(optional).</p></li>
<li><p>Record any additional <em>deployment notes</em>
(optional).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>save camera trap point</em> button.</p></li>
<li><p>Use flagging tape in a nearby tree to mark the location for easy
camera trap re-equipping or retrieval. Ensure the flagging tape is not
in the field of view of the camera trap. If there is a security risk, do
not mark the location of the camera trap, it can be located using its
coordinates.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 8–40 for each proposed camera trap point for the
selected <em>survey type</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Once all camera traps for the selected <em>survey type</em> have
been deployed, select the <em>finish protocol</em> button. Check the
data summary before submitting the collection.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat Steps 4–42 for a different <em>survey type</em> if
required.</p></li>
