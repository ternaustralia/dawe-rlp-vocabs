  <li>
    <p>
      The camera traps should have been prepared and calibrated prior to the
      field survey. If this has not been done, refer to the Camera trap
      preparation and calibration section to install batteries, SD cards and
      desiccant packets (for humid/wet conditions), and configure the settings
      for each camera trap before continuing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure the <em>Plot selection and layout</em> module has been completed to
      establish and identifiy the fauna plot, and mark out the plot boundaries
      and trapping configuration, including the camera trap points, with very
      high accuracy using the Trimble® R1.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the ‘Camera traps’ module and then the ‘Fauna plot protocol’ in the
      App. The App will automatically record a <em>Survey ID</em> and
      <em>Survey name</em> (e.g. Project A – Camera trap deployment), as well as
      the <em>Protocol name</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the <em>Fauna plot</em> from the drop-down list (established during
      the <em>Plot selection and layout module</em>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the ‘Camera trap deployment’ button. The App will automatically
      record a <em>Deployment ID</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Move to a camera trap point with the required equipment. Press the ‘i’
      button and/or see Appendix for the different camera trap configurations
      depending on the number of camera traps (2–5).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Camera trap point</em> from the drop-down list (‘N’, ‘S’,
      ‘E’, ‘W’, ‘Centre’).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Scan the immediate area to ensure it is suitable to secure a camera trap
      mounting post (or is there a large tree trunk or stem) and bait station
      post either 1.5 or 2.5 m away in a southerly direction (set 2 camera traps
      1.5 m away and 3 camera traps 2.5 m away; see Camera trap deployment and
      Appendix for configurations with less than 5 camera traps). If the
      immediate area is not suitable to secure the posts (e.g. rocky, dense
      vegetation), move to the nearest suitable area. Press the ‘Add camera trap
      point’ button to record the position of tuhe camera trap point in the App
      using the Trimble® R1 to ensure high spatial accuracy. The App will
      automatically record the <em>Latitude</em>, <em>Longitude</em> and
      <em>Geodetic datum</em> of the camera trap point.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the camera trap point is located on sloped ground, record the
      <em>Slope</em> and <em>Aspect</em> using the inclinometer and compass on
      your device, or an inclinometer and compass. See Camera trap deployment
      for guidelines to set camera traps on sloped ground. If the area is flat
      leave the default <em>Slope</em> (‘0°’) and <em>Aspect</em> (‘0°’; north =
      '360°') values.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Install the bait station first so you have a focal point when setting up
      the camera trap. Use a steel post driver or mash hammer to secure a
      mounting post into the ground. Ensure the post remains tall enough so the
      bait container is 30 cm above the ground, but is secure enough that it
      cannot be easily knocked over by animals.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Secure the bait container to the post 30 cm above the ground using a
      mounting apparatus. The App will pre-record the
      <em>Bait container height</em> as 30 cm. Where ants may be a problem,
      spread dust or granular insecticide for ants around the base of the bait
      station.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Lure type</em> as ‘Edible’ from the drop-down list. Record
      the <em>Lure variety</em> as ‘Standard small mammal bait mix’ from the
      drop-down. Otherwise, record if an alternate
      <em>Lure type</em> (‘Olfactory’, ‘Auditory’ or ‘Visual’) and
      <em>Lure variety</em> are used from the drop-down lists or manual entry.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use a pocket tape measure to measure either 1.5 or 2.5 m in a northerly
      direction from the base of the bait station to where the camera trap will
      be deployed (set 2 camera traps 1.5 m away and 3 camera traps 2.5 m away;
      see Camera trap deployment for configurations with less than 5 camera
      traps). Record the <em>Distance to bait</em><em>station</em> (i.e. the
      between the camera trap and bait station) from the drop-down list (1.5 or
      2.5 m).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use a steel post driver or mash hammer to secure a camera trap mounting
      post into the ground. Ensure the post remains tall enough so the top of
      the mounted camera trap is 70 cm above the ground. If there is a large
      tree trunk or stem in a suitable position this can be used. Ensure the
      post is secure or the tree trunk or stem is large enough to prevent false
      triggers from camera movement. Record the <em>Camera trap mount</em> as
      from the drop-down list (e.g. ‘Star dropper’, ‘Tree’).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Before mounting the camera trap, open the unit and check and record the
      <em>Camera trap number</em> and <em>SD card number</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Camera trap make</em> (i.e. ‘Reconyx’),
      <em>Camera trap model</em> (i.e. ‘HC550’ or ‘PC850’),
      <em>Camera trap year</em> (same models may vary between years),
      <em>Illumination</em> (i.e. ‘LED white flash’),
      <em>Activation mechanism</em> (i.e. ‘PIR’) and <em>Trigger speed</em> in
      seconds (i.e. ‘0.2’). Once the data is entered for the first camera trap
      you configure, your previous selections will automatically appear for each
      subsquent camera trap.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Switch the camera trap ‘ON’ and navigate to the ‘ADVANCED’ menu. Check the
      following camera trap settings:
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Check the <em>Image resolution</em> is set to ‘3.1 megapixels’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check the <em>Sensor sensitivity</em> is set to ‘High’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check the <em>Pictures per trigger</em> is set to ‘5’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check the <em>Picture interval</em> is set to ‘RapidFire’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check that <em>Night mode</em> is set to ‘Fast Shutter’ to increase image
      sharpness.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check that <em>Quiet period</em> is set to ‘No Delay’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check the <em>Date</em> and <em>Time</em> and the
      <em>Unit of temperature</em> is set to ‘Celcius’.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check the <em>User label</em> is set to the relevant fauna plot/camera
      code.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check the <em>Battery type</em> is set to match the batteries being used
      (i.e. ‘NiMH’).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ol start="18" type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Camera trap settings</em> from step 17. Once the data is
      entered for the first camera trap you configure, your previous selections
      will automatically appear for each subsquent camera trap. You will just
      need to update the <em>Camera trap number</em> and
      <em>SD card number</em> in the App, and <em>User label</em> in the camera
      trap and the App. Switch ‘OFF’ and close the camera trap.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Record the media type as ‘Burst’ from the drop-down list.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ol start="20" type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Using a mounting apparatus, mount the camera trap so that the top is 70 cm
      above the ground and facing the bait station. The App will pre-record the
      <em>Camera trap height</em> as ‘70 cm’.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The camera trap should be facing south whereever possible (otherwise in a
      southery direction). Record the <em>Camera trap direction</em> relative to
      north (0–359°) using the compass on your mobile device, or a compass.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use chocks or woody debris from within the plot to angle the camera so it
      captures the base of the bait station in the middle of the frame. The app
      will automatically record the vertical <em>Camera trap angle</em> from
      horizontal based on its height and distance from the bait station (-25° at
      1.5 m distance and -16° at 2.5 m distance). If the camera trap point is on
      sloped ground, measure and update the <em>Camera trap angle</em> using a
      protractor.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the sensor screen and camera lens are clean.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check that there are no obstacles in front of the sensor, flash unit or
      camera lens (e.g. branches, mounting straps, flagging tape).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Undertake site preparation to prevent false triggers, maximise species
      identification and reduce fire risk to equipment. Clear all vegetation
      (low hanging vegetation, grass, sticks, leaves, etc.) between where the
      camera and bait station will be installed. Clear vegetation at least 1 m
      behind the bait station and at least 1 m around the camera trap (to
      mitigate fire damage). Consider the field of view of the sensor and clear
      vegetation at least 1.5 m either side of the bait station.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Press the ‘Camera trap photo’ button to record a photo of the camera trap
      and bait station using your device’s camera.

<p style="color: orange">Camera trap redeployment</p>
<p>
  The following steps should be followed to check and replace camera trap
  batteries and SD cards and redeploy each camera trap in the same location
  using the same settings and mode of deployment. If recovering a camera trap
  and deploying at a new camera trap point, refer to Camera trap redeployment.
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>Traverse the fauna plot and locate each camera trap point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When you are arriving at a camera trap point, approach it from the front
      to trigger a ‘capture’ sequence, which is used to indicate the end of the
      sampling period.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the camera trap is missing, search the vicinity as it may have been
      dislodged and shifted by fauna. If you cannot find the camera trap, you
      will record it as ‘Missing’ in step 9.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the ‘Camera traps’ module and then the ‘Fauna plot protocol’ in the
      App. The App will automatically record a <em>Survey ID</em> and
      <em>Survey name</em> (e.g. Project A – Camera trap redeployment), as well
      as the <em>Protocol name</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>
    <p>Keeping the camera trap mounted, open and turn it ‘OFF’ to disarm it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Operational status</em> from the drop-down list
      (‘Operational’, ‘SD card full’, ‘Batteries flat’, ‘Not operational’,
      ‘Missing’). Turn the camera trap ‘ON’ and navigate to the ‘CHECK STATUS’
      function. The number of images captured, amount of space on the SD card
      and amount of battery power remaining will be displayed. Record the
      <em>Number of images</em>. If the display is blank, the batteries may be
      flat. Replace the batteries and switch the camera trap ‘ON’ to determine
      if the camera trap was not operational due to flat batteries or being
      damaged.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switch the camera trap ‘OFF’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Replace the batteries, SD card and desiccant packet (for humid/wet
      conditions). Record the <em>Battery type</em> and <em>SD card number</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Replace the bait in the bait container. Record the <em>Lure type</em> as
      ‘Edible’ from the drop-down list. Record the <em>Lure variety</em> as
      ‘Standard small mammal bait mix’ from the drop-down. Otherwise, record if
      an alternate <em>Lure type</em> (‘Olfactory’, ‘Auditory’ or ‘Visual’) and
      <em>Lure variety</em> are used from the drop-down lists or manual entry.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirm that the <em>Bait container height</em> is ’30 cm’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Replace the bait container if it is missing (record this in
      <em>Redeployment observations</em>). Where ants may be a problem, spread
      dust or granular insecticide for ants around the base of the bait station.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the camera trap is not operational or missing, replace the camera trap
      and record the <em>Camera trap number</em>, <em>Battery type</em> and
      <em>SD card number</em>. If the camera trap is missing consider the
      security risk and whether redeployment is worthwhile.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Camera trap model</em> (i.e. ‘HC550’ or ‘PC850’) and
      <em>Camera trap year</em> (same model may vary between years).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Replace any mounting posts that are missing (record this in
      <em>Redeployment observations</em>). Use a steel post driver or mash
      hammer to secure a camera trap mounting post into the ground. Ensure the
      post remains tall enough so the top of the mounted camera trap is 70 cm
      above the ground. If there is a large tree trunk or stem in a suitable
      position this can be used. Ensure the post is secure or the tree trunk or
      stem is large enough to prevent false triggers from camera movement.
      Record the <em>Camera trap mount</em> as from the drop-down list (e.g.
      ‘Star dropper’, ‘Tree’).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The <em>Slope</em> and <em>Aspect</em> should match the deployment data.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Using a mounting apparatus, mount the camera trap so that the top is 70 cm
      above the ground and facing the bait station. The Camera trap height
      should match the deployment data (i.e. ’70 cm’).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use chocks or woody debris from within the plot to angle the camera so it
      captures the base of the bait station in the middle of the frame. The app
      will automatically record the vertical <em>Camera trap angle</em> from
      horizontal based on its height and distance from the bait station (-25° at
      1.5 m distance and -16° at 2.5 m distance). If the camera trap point is on
      sloped ground, measure and update the <em>Camera trap angle</em> using a
      protractor.

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p>
  The following points are adapted from Gillespie <em>et al.</em> (2015), Molloy
  (2018) and TEAM Network (2011b).
</p>
<p style="color: orange">Camera trap deployment</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The fauna plot protocol deploys 2–5 camera traps in a diamond
      configuration within the fauna plot, at the N, S, E and W mid-points of
      the 100 x 100 m plot boundaries, as well as the centre of the plot
      (Appendix).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where possible, camera traps should be placed in a variety of different
      micro-habitats and situations within the fauna plot, as different species
      will use different parts of the landscape. Within the vicinity of each
      proposed camera trap point, look for signs of animal paths, or natural
      openings through the area, such as adjacent to rock ledges or creek beds;
      also place camera traps in areas with contrasting vegetation structures,
      such as densely vegetated versus open areas.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Avoid deploying camera traps in areas where there is a risk of inundation
      during the deployment period.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Deploy camera traps so that they are facing south to prevent glare and sun
      damage to the camera lens and sensor. Avoid deploying with east and
      west-facing orientations to reduce false triggers from the rising and
      setting of the sun.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      There is evidence of overheating and mulfunction of camera trap batteries
      on days where daytime temperatures exceed 40<sup>o</sup>C. Depending on
      the location and time of year, shade may need to be provided to protect
      the back of the camera trap from sun expopsure (Dundas
      <em>et al.</em> 2019).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In sloped terrain, camera traps should be angled and parallel to the
      ground to ensure detection.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Level camera trap points are preferable as they provide undistorted and
      unobstructed view of subjects, particularly smaller animals. Downward
      slopes increase the size of blind zones (although this can be partially
      rectified by angling the camera trap downward) and upward slopes reduce
      the photographed area and proved a greater opportunity for concealment by
      increasing the effect of on ground structures.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Deploy camera traps for a minimum of 5 weeks, preferably encompassing the
      time period that ground trapping is undertaken. Camera traps may be
      deployed 3–4 weeks before ground trapping occurs and collected upon
      completion, or deployed during ground trapping sessions and recovered
      several weeks later. If this is not possible, then the camera trapping
      session should take place within 4 weeks of the ground trapping session.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If camera traps are deployed while ground trapping is being undertaken,
      take care to avoid detection zones to prevent false triggers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If five camera traps are deployed, install two bait stations 1.5 m away
      and three 2.5 m away from the camera traps.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The recommended deployment period for five camera traps is five weeks
      (Table 4).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If four camera traps are deployed, install two bait stations 1.5 m away
      and two 2.5 m away from the camera traps.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The recommended deployment period for four camera traps is six weeks
      (Table 4).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If 3 camera traps are deployed, install one bait station 1.5 m away and
      two 2.5 m away from the camera traps.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The recommend deployment period for three camera traps is seven weeks
      (Table 4).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If 2 camera traps are deployed, install one bait station 1.5 m away and
      one 2.5 m away from the camera traps.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The recommend deployment period for two camera traps is eight weeks (Table
      4).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The fauna plot protocol has been designed to be used in conjunction with a
      vertebrate fauna survey (see the <em>Vertebrate fauna</em> module).
      However, the protocol can be undertaken without any live trapping.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Refer to the Reconyx HC550 and PC850 user manuals for guidance in the
      operation and functionality of the camera traps.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check that the housing of each camera trap is properly closed to prevent
      moisture damaging the electronics.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All camera traps used in a survey should all be set up with the same
      settings.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Theft and vandalism inevitably occur. Consider the risk of this in your
      project area and use anit-theft devices. Cable-locking camera traps or
      using security boxes will act as a deterrent and is advisable in areas
      with high human visitation or if setting camera traps along vehicle or
      walking tracks.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When multiple camera traps are deployed it is advisable to use combination
      locks, or have locks keyed-alike, to avoid having to carry multiple keys
      into the field. Coil excess cable length up off the ground.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      in many cases, people who discover cameras may not disturb them, but will
      be curious about why they are there. Attaching a small sign to the side of
      each camera with a brief description of the project and some contact
      information is likely to satisfy curiosity and may help to limit vandalism
      or other interference.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Minimise animal interference of camera traps by securing them tightly,
      securing the door with a cable tie, or placing the camera trap inside a
      metal security box. Reconyx manufacture sturdy metal cases for their
      cameras for additional protection if needed.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Site preparation</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Careful site clearing is important to minimise false triggers, maximise
      identification of animals and reduce fire risk to equipment.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Determine what vegetation may cause false triggers, such as overhanging
      branches, or plants nearby that may grow into the sensor field during
      deployment and remove with secateurs or rake as necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If deployment will extend over a growing period, dig out perennial grass
      and shrub bases of the cleared area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Avoid piling cleared material right next to the camera trap point as this
      may just blow across the field of vision, triggering false images, or
      impede animal access.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If in doubt regarding vegetation clearing, set the camera trap and trigger
      it to take a couple of photos, then remove the SD card and put it into a
      hand-held digital camera to check field of view.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Installing bait stations</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Standard small mammal bait mix (i.e. peanut butter, rolled oats and honey)
      should be used for general surveys.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If alterative an alternative type and variety of lure are used for
      specific projects or target species, record this information in the App.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Bait containers are an 80 mm length of PVC pipe with a ventilated end cap
      on each end to allow scent to escape. A ventilated end cap with an
      overhanging cover on it is recommended to reduce dehydration and water
      diluting the bait in the wet conditions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Bait stations can also be interfered with if not secured or designed
      properly. Crows and some rat species are notorious for breaking into or
      damaging bait stations; Dingoes will readily remove bait stations that are
      not adequately secured.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Recovering camera traps</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is important to confirm whether the camera trap was operational for the
      whole survey period. If there is no capture sequence on recovery of the
      camera trap it makes it impossible to know whether it was operational for
      the full deployment period. For example, if the last image occurs in week
      3 of 4, this could reflect either no animals at the camera trap point post
      week 3 or a camera malfunction sometime post this time.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Redeploying camera traps</p>

    <p>
      It is important to confirm whether the camera trap was operational for the
      whole survey period. If there is no capture sequence on recovery of the

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the SD card was full, it is recommended that the SD card is replaced
      with one with greater storage capacity or checking the SD card storage at
      a shorter period to maintain camera trap functionality.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the batteries were flat, it is recommended that they be checked at a
      shorter period to maintain camera trap functionality.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consider if the site preparation might have caused false triggers and
      undertaken more clearance if necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the camera trap was stolen or vandalised, consider the risk of this
      happening again and if anti-theft devices and measures will be enough to
      prevent this.
