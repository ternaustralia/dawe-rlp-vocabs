  The <em>Camera traps</em> module covers three camera trapping protocols that
  can be undertaken depending on the purpose of your project:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Fauna plot protocol – standardised deployment of Reconyx 2–5 white flash
      camera traps and accompanying bait stations in a fauna plot, either in
      conjunction with a vertebrate fauna survey (recommended) or stand alone.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Array protocol – many camera traps (e.g. 20–30) deployed in a systematic
      array (e.g. grid, transect) to monitor fauna occupancy and density in the
      project area (via downstream capture-mark-recapture methods and random
      encounter models).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Targeted protocol – remote cameras deliberately deployed at features of
      interest (e.g. suitable habitat, trail intersections, waterpoints, tree
      hollows, inflorescences) in the project area to maximise fauna detection,
      supplement species inventory, or record behaviour, with the option to
      capture video, orientate camera traps horizontally (i.e. downward-facing
      detection zone and field of view) to survey small mammals and reptiles,
      and use bait stations or lures.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The module covers pre-field survey tasks, including study design
  considerations and remote camera preparation to maximise species detection and
  identification whilst minimising false triggers, as well as post-field survey
  tasks, including data storage, processing, and analysis.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Fauna plot</em> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for
  the standardised deployment and recovery or redeployment of camera traps in a
  fauna plot, including standards for camera make, model and settings, camera
  placement and orientation, site preparation, bait station installation,
  deployment period, and entering the data directly into the App. The protocol
  is based on the standard operating procedure for camera trapping developed by
  the Northern Territory Flora and Fauna Division (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015), and Bush Heritage Australia’s camera trap guidelines
  (Bush Heritage Australia 2021). Both standardised methodologies were developed
  from extensive trialing of various camera trap survey designs and consultation
  with a range of expert practitioners, to optimise the effectiveness and
  consistency of camera traps for general vertebrate fauna surveys and
  monitoring. For a standardised protocol that covers the effective and
  consistent use and deployment of remote cameras as part of general vertebrate
  biodiversity surveys (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015), the fauna plot protocol
  is the best approach.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Array</em> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for
  deployment, recovery and redeployment of camera traps in an array within the
  project area, including locating camera trap points in an evenly spaced grid
  or at regular intervals along a transect, and then micrositing the exact
  camera trap point locations within the grid or transect to optimise fauna
  detections, and recording all associated data (e.g. camera trap make, model
  and settings, camera trap placement and orientation, focal point, target
  species if applicable, deployment period) in a standardised manner directly
  into the App. The protocol has been developed based on the Terrestrial
  Vertebrate (formerly Camera Trap) Monitoring Protocol (TEAM Network 2011b).
  This protocol was developed from the collective experience of many field
  biologists with experience using camera trap arrays to estimate the abundance
  of a range of terrestrial mammal and bird species. The sampling design was
  carefully specified to maximise the probability of detecting an adequate
  sample of terrestrial mammal and bird species. It was intended to monitor
  changes in the community of ground-dwelling, terrestrial vertebrates, but not
  to monitor the abundance of individuals species. The sampling design
  compromised between detecting species that range over large areas (&gt;100
  km<sup>2</sup>) and those with smaller home ranges (~1 km<sup>2</sup>). The
  camera trap array protocol outlined here differs in that it allows the
  flexibility to monitor the community or individual species. Surveyors can
  select the density and number of camera traps, and the deployment period based
  on the aims of their project, with this information recorded in a standarised
  manner among projects using the App.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to undertake a general survey of the fauna across a project or
  study area without altering the behaviour of that fauna, the
  <em>Array</em> protocol is the most effective approach. As this protocol can
  be used to sample a broad area simultaneously and uniformly it provides a
  better sample size than the other protocols, thereby enabling a more accurate
  indication of species abundance over the whole survey area. For this reason,
  an indicated absence (where a species is not detected) from a camera trap
  array sample is more likely to reflect a true absence (where a species is not
  present) than the other protocols. If resources are limited, establishing a
  transect through the most representative part of the survey area and placing
  camera traps at pre-determined intervals along that transect, might be the
  best approach. However, indicated absences obtained from transect samples
  cannot be reliably used as an indication of true absence. It is possible to
  combine grid and transect approaches (Molloy 2018).
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Targeted</em> protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for the
  deployment, recovery and redeployment of camera traps at features of interest
  within the project area, including identifying features of interest, micro
  siting the exact camera trap point locations to optimize fauna detections,
  installing bait stations, and recording all associated data (e.g. camera trap
  make, model and settings, camera trap placement and orientation, focal point,
  target species if applicable, bait station details, deployment period) in a
  standardized manner directly into the App. The targeted protocol may be used
  in combination with the fauna plot protocol to supplement species inventory
  when undertaking fauna monitoring within a project area. The targeted protocol
  has been included in recognition that deliberately biased placement of camera
  traps at features of interest are a commonly used camera trapping sampling
  strategy (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Targeted camera trapping can also be
  undertaken as part of the <em>Targeted surveys</em> module and can be used in
  combination with a range of other targeted methods.
</p>
<p>
  If you are monitoring the behaviour of fauna under a certain set of
  conditions, sampling fauna at a specific set of points for experimental
  purposes (e.g., to examine responses of fauna to differing vegetation or
  specific landscape parameters), or monitoring fauna at a place of activity or
  gathering point such as a trail intersection, water point or nest site, the
  <em>Targeted</em> protocol is the most effective approach. This protocol
  allows researchers and practitioners to monitor a large area with minimal
  resources and to answer specific research questions. However, this approach is
  highly susceptible to bias and provides a limited insight into the ecology of
  the greater landscape as a whole (Molloy 2018).
</p>
<p>
  The data standards for all three protocols are based on the
  <em>Camera Trap Metadata Standard</em> developed by Forrester
  <em>et al.</em> (2016), an open data standard for storing and sharing camera
  trap data. The standard captures information necessary to share data between
  projects and offers a foundation for collecting the more detailed data needed
  for downstream analyses. The standard captures information about study design,
  the type of camera trap used, and the location and species names for all
  detections, among others, in a standardized manner. The standard is compatible
  with the Federal Geographic Data Committee, the Darwin Core, the Ecological
  Metadata Language, and the Audubon Core metadata standards to allow data to be
  easily cross referenced with existing data repositories, such as DataONE
  (Forrester <em>et al.</em> 2016).
</p>
<p>The <em>Camera traps</em> module is linked to the following modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Plot selection and layout</em> – the fauna plot protocol requires a
      fauna plot to be selected, established and laid out.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Vegetation mapping</em> – Fauna habitats in the project area and fauna
      plot selection can be informed by the results of the
      <em>Vegetation mapping</em> module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Vertebrate fauna</em> – camera traps can be used in combination with a
      range of other vertebrate fauna survey methods (e.g. pitfall trapping).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Targeted surveys</em> – camera traps can be recorded as part of
      targeted surveys and can be used in combination with a range of other
      targeted measures.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Interventions</em> – camera traps can be used to detect distribution
      and population trends associated with interventions to conserve threatened
      species, as well as monitor vertebrate pest population control.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pre-field survey tasks</strong></p>
<p style="color: blue">
  <strong>Study design and planning considerations</strong>
</p>
<p>
  For many camera trapping applications, such as surveying the distribution of
  species, estimating species abundance, or monitoring changes in these
  parameters through time, proper attention must be given to the study design,
  the make and model of the camera trap used, camera trap deployment, and what
  data is collected and how it will be analysed. Poorly designed surveys often
  result in data which cannot be used to answer the question of interest
  (Gillespie et al. 2015).
</p>
<p>
  A clear and defined statement of the study objectives and why camera traps are
  the best survey tool to achieve these objectives is an important component of
  camera trapping studies, which can range from investigations of behaviour,
  species inventory and assessing abundance, as well as exploratory, where the
  data produced (e.g. an image of a new species, or a range extension for an
  existing species) provides important information to address particular
  scientific or management questions. The study design and methodology should
  align with the clearly defined objectives (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a).
</p>
<p>
  This section includes two decision keys (Figure 1 and Figure 2) to ensure the
  appropriate use of camera traps and the three camera trapping protocols, as
  well as design and planning considerations for detection, camera trap make and
  model, the number and density of camera traps in an array, deployment period,
  the target species, use of attractants, and permits and ethics.
</p>
<p style="color: blue">Camera trap decision keys</p>
<p>
  The following two decision keys will help you determine whether or not camera
  traps are suitable to use and which protocol is recommended, based on the
  objectives of your survey, the available resources and the target species
  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Start with Decision Key 1 (Figure 1). If your survey objectives are to
  determine species distribution, investigate habitat preferences or undertake
  monitoring, you will continue in Decision Key 1 (Figure 1). If your survey
  objectives are to confirm species presence, supplement species inventory or
  investigate species behaviour, you will go to Decision Key 2 (Figure 2).

<p style="color: blue">Detection</p>
<p>
  Like any fauna survey methodology, camera trap surveys must address common
  sources of sampling error to reliably assess animal populations, including
  imperfect detection – where individuals or species present within a sampling
  are not always detected. Camera trap surveys, which sample mobile species,
  must consider imperfect detection at the camera trap scale, where fauna
  passing through the relatively small camera trap detection zone fail to be
  detected, and at the study area scale, where fauna using the study area that
  the camera trap is assumed to sample fail to be detected (Figure) (Burton
  <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  The probability of detection (i.e. the probability that a species will be
  detected during a survey if it is present within the study area; Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015) is affected by several factors at the camera trap scale,
  including camera trap specifications, deployment mode, animal body size and
  temperature, animal movement speed, behaviour and group size, ambient
  temperature and light, and vegetation and other obstructions, and at the study
  area scale, including animal density and movement, the size and selection of
  sampling units, the number and location of camera traps, the use of
  attractant, the deployment period, and analytical assumptions (Burton
  <em>et al.</em> 2015). Consideration of these factors (see below) and
  following the carefully planned camera trapping protocols are imperative to
  reduce detection bias in camera trap field data collection. However,
  researchers will need to consider analytical approaches to contend with
  imperfect detection when undertaking downstream analyses (e.g.
  capture-mark-recapture methods, random encounter models).

<p style="color: blue">Camera trap selection</p>
<p>
  The make and model of the camera traps used in a survey have important
  consequences for species detectability and the interpretation and
  repeatability of results. There are numerous manufacturers (e.g. Reconyx,
  Pixcontroller, Buckeye, Cuddeback, Bushnell, Scoutguard) that typically have
  multiple camera trap models available to researchers and practitioners. These
  makes and models vary in their trigger speed, detection zone, sensor
  sensitivity, how they detect fauna (e.g. PIR or AIR sensors) and how they
  illuminate the scene at night (e.g. white or infrared flash), among others
  (Table 2). Websites such as TrailCamPro.com provide comparative performance
  statistics as well specifications for many popular models (Meek
  <em>et al.</em> 2014a). The camera trap features that should be evaluated when
  selecting a camera trap model are summarised in Table 2. Only a single model
  of camera trap should be used in a study because performance is likely to vary
  among models.
</p>
<p>
  Recording the make and model (including the manufacturing year for models that
  are updated frequently but keep the same name) of the camera traps used in a
  study ensures repeatability of the methods and comparability of the results,
  both among projects and monitoring surveys within the same project. Data of
  the remaining camera trap features summarised in Table 2 should also be
  collected with the camera trap make, model and year as these features are not
  always apparent.
</p>
<p>
  Choosing the right tool for the job is common sense, but there are many
  examples where a poor choice of camera trap negatively affects the outcome.
  For example, images captured with infrared flash are monochrome and of
  relatively low resolution compared to those taken with a white light flash.
  Remote cameras with infrared flash are therefore not well suited to surveys of
  species that may be difficult to identify accurately from poor-quality images,
  such as many small mammal species. The possibility that the species of
  interest might be disturbed by a white light flash or the noises made by
  cameras and subsequently avoid the camera is also an important consideration
  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Furthermore, studies of animal use (e.g.
  burrows, tree hollows) may be better carried out using camera traps with an
  AIR sensor, rather than a PIR sensor, and choosing a camera trap with a small
  detection zone and a slow trigger response may be unsuccessful in detecting
  small and fast-moving animals at close range (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a).
</p>
<p>
  Reconyx Hyperfire camera traps are the most widely used camera trap for
  wildlife research (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012; Meek <em>et al.</em> 2015; Meek
  2018). Protocols that specify the use of Reconyx camera traps in Australia
  include the standard operating procedure for camera trapping in northern
  Australia developed by the Northern Territory Flora and Fauna Division
  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015), and Bush Heritage Australia’s camera trap
  guidelines (Bush Heritage Australia 2021). Both of these protocols use Reconyx
  HC550 or PC850 camera for data consistency and comparability. These models
  have similar specifications and setting options, as well as LED white flash
  capability, which importantly allows colour images to be captured during the
  day and night, and significantly improves species identification capability
  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Internationally, the Terrestrial Vertebrate
  (formerly Camera Trap) Monitoring Protocol requires the use of Reconyx camera
  traps, particularly the HC500 or PC800 models, depending on the site’s climate
  (PC800 models used in humid climates). This is due to their rapid response
  time, infrared flash, multi-fire capabilities and unique design for field
  conditions (TEAM Network 2011b).

      <td>Sensor (PIR or AIR)</td>
      <td>
        Most camera traps have passive infrared (PIR) sensor, which detect a
        differential in temperature and motion between a subject and the
        background temperature. When ambient temperature falls within the body
        temperature range of most mammals (31.5–36.5° C), PIR camera traps can
        be unreliable. PIR sensors can also be triggered by the movement of
        pockets of hot air or by the motion of warm vegetation in the detection
        zone. This problem can be limited by avoiding pointing the camera trap
        directly to a background that is under sun incidence. Active infrared
        (AIR) sensors, which respond to a break in an infrared beam between two
        units spaced apart, are not widely used but may, for example, be
        suitable for studies of animal use of burrows or tree hollows.

      <td>Trigger speed</td>
      <td>
        A fundamental feature of camera traps, if not the critical feature. Fast
        trigger speeds are necessary to capture fast moving targets. Fast
        trigger speeds may be less necessary if using a bait station.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Flash type (white or infrared)</td>
      <td>
        Camera traps with white flash are critical to capture sharp and colour
        images at night as well as during the day. This is fundamental in
        studies that require individual recognition or for faunal inventories,
        as colour images improve species identification. Currently, classic
        Xenon white flashes produce sharper images than white LED flashes due to
        their greater power and flash duration that is short enough to freeze
        moving animals. Camera traps with infrared flash use arrays of LEDs that
        emit infrared light, mostly in the range of 700–1000 nm. The images
        captured are often in grey-scale or may have a reddish-pink tinge.
        Infrared flashes tend to be less obvious to fauna, use less energy and
        tend to have quicker trigger speeds than white flashes. Recently,
        no-glow (also called “black”) infrared flashes have been introduced to
        minimise the red glow emitted by standard infrared LEDs which is seen by
        animals. A limited number of PIR camera trap models (e.g. Spypoint,
        Bolymedia) have dual flashes (Xenon and infrared).

    <tr>
      <td>Detection zone</td>
      <td>
        Critical feature that varies widely among current models (15.8–324.1 m;
        Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012). Camera traps with a narrow detection zone
        (i.e. smaller than the field of view) usually have fast trigger speeds
        and will take the photo when the animal is well within the field of
        view. The detection zone can be increased to some extent by moving the
        camera trap further away from the target, which can compensate for slow
        trigger speeds.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Number of photos taken, recovery time, and video</td>
      <td>
        Capability to capture bursts of images in rapid sequence (i.e. fast
        recovery time) may be important for improved species identification (as
        chances of obtaining a good image within a burst will be increased),
        recording individuals within family groups and packs, and analysis of
        passing sequences to derive day range, which is a critical parameter in
        the Random Encounter Model (REM; Rowcliffe <em>et al.</em> 2008). At
        night, Xenon white flash cameras are not capable to take photo bursts or
        videos due to the recharge time of flash that can take ≥ 30 seconds, a
        limitation that is overcome by LED white flash camera traps. Rapid image
        sequences and video can be useful for behavioural studies or specific
        research needs. However, data handling is more time consuming, SD cards
        are filled quicker and power consumption is greater, hence videos are
        not recommended when photographs alone provide the data required.

        Regulates the sensor responsiveness to the target by changing the heat

    <tr>
      <td>Flash intensity</td>
      <td>
        A number of camera trap models allow flash intensity to be adjusted
        automatically to the distance to the subject. Some models enable the
        amount of light generated by the white flash to be adjusted for two to
        three distance settings. However, the flash of most models is programmed
        for maximum distance and illumination.

    <tr>
      <td>Power autonomy</td>
      <td>
        Studies in remote areas and/or with long deployment periods require high
        power autonomy. Camera traps with white flash generally consume more
        battery power then those with infrared flash. The three most common
        battery types used by camera traps are AA Lithium, Nickel Metal Hydride
        (NiMH) and Alkaline, which are discussed in the Batteries section.
        Despite the higher initial costs, rechargeable NiMH batteries are
        recommended as long as camera trap performances are not altered. A
        number of camera models (e.g. Spypoint, Bolymedia, Uway) mount an input
        jack for external batteries or small solar panels so higher capacity,
        lead-acid batteries can be used to prolong deployment.

    <tr>
      <td>Image resolution, sharpness and clarity</td>
      <td>
        Most camera traps capture medium-to-high resolution images and video.
        However, the sharpness and clarity of colour images, needed to identify
        individuals and species, are also critical features. For images captured
        at night, only those taken with a white Xenon flash are clear and sharp
        enough to identify naturally marked individuals. Image resolution and
        clarity is often critical when targeting small animals, especially where
        sympatric species coexist with similar morphological features.

        Housing, camouflage and water and insect proof qualities of camera traps
        extremely important, especially where extreme weather conditions are
        experienced (e.g. snow, rainfall and humidity). In addition, ability to
        protect cameras with metal cases and lock them is critical against theft
        and/or damage by large animals. Housing should allow easy attachment of
        the unit to the support or tree used and allow access to replace
        batteries and SD cards when attached to the support. Housing should
        ideally have a tripod stud on the rear and underside to attach mounting
        brackets.

      <td>Camera programming and setting</td>
      <td>
        Should be as simple as possible, to allow researchers and practitioners
        with varying degree of experience to set camera traps consistently and
        without errors. The option of programming the operation time, to avoid
        unnecessary images, may be useful for example when only nocturnal
        species are targeted. Setting camera traps to take an image at regular
        intervals in time (i.e. time lapse), either at pre-designated intervals
        or regular intervals following a motion detection, may be useful to
        decrease data load while confirming presence or examine temporal
        activity of invertebrates (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2011; Potter
        <em>et al.</em> 2021).

<p style="color: blue">Target species</p>
<p>
  The target species, suites of species, or community of interest should be
  clearly identified when planning camera trap surveys. This is because the
  study design, camera trap model, camera trap point selection, mode of
  deployment, deployment period and type and variety of lure, if used, should be
  tailored to the target fauna to maximise detection probability (Harmsen
  <em>et al.</em> 2010; Rovero <em>et al.</em> 2013; Diete <em>et al.</em> 2016;
  Fancourt <em>et al.</em> 2018; Moore <em>et al.</em> 2020a), with
  consideration of their size, behaviour and mode of body temperature
  regulation. For example, to maximise numbat (500–700 g mammal) detection,
  Swift 3C wide-angle camera traps set 25 cm above the ground are recommended as
  they recorded 89% of known events, compared to Swift 3C standard (51%) and
  Reconyx PC900 camera traps (37%). Furthermore, camera traps mounted at 2 m
  above the ground and angled towards the ground resulted in significantly more
  identifications of individual numbats than those mounted at 1 m and 1.25 m
  (Seidlitz <em>et al.</em> 2020). If using camera traps to survey small
  mammals, models with white flash will likely be required to capture the
  characteristic features required to distinguish similar-looking sympatric
  species with an acceptable level of precision (Meek and Vernes 2015). Video
  has also been crucial to distinguish two antechinus species, with their
  behaviour and movements being particularly diagnostic (Gray
  <em>et al.</em> 2017).
</p>
<p>
  Tracks and roads have been shown to facilitate movement of introduced
  predators such as feral cats and foxes (Carter <em>et al.</em> 2012), and
  consequently, placing camera traps along them will increase the probability of
  detection (Meek 2018). Indeed, on-road detectability using camera traps was
  estimated to be seven times higher for cats and three times higher for foxes
  than off-road detectability. Furthermore, targeting camera trap survey effort
  on-road yielded the greatest power for detecting declines in both species
  (Geyle <em>et al.</em> 2020), which is useful for monitoring the success of
  lethal baiting programs.
</p>
<p>
  The majority of camera traps work by sensing objects that move and are a
  different temperature relative to the background surface and objects. They are
  therefore most suited to detecting mammals and to a lesser extent birds (i.e.
  endotherms; TEAM Network 2011b; Cloyed <em>et al.</em> 2018), but are
  generally less sensitive at detecting reptiles and amphibians (i.e.
  ectotherms; Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, camera traps positioned
  facing downwards have successfully monitored reptiles using bait stations to
  attract species to the detection zone, drift fences to direct species towards
  the detection zone, and cork tiles to create a sufficient thermal contrast
  between the tile, which is heated by the sun, and the species (Welbourne
  <em>et al.</em> 2015; Moore <em>et al.</em> 2020a). More recently, this
  approach was refined by reducing the focal length of Reconxy camera traps to
  avoid blurry images of when placing them facing downwards, 70 cm above the
  ground, This allowed small, similar looking sympatric species to be
  differentiated (Welbourne <em>et al.</em> 2019). Reconyx can alter the focal
  length of their professional series of camera traps at the time of purchase,
  but it is also possible for practitioners to adjust this themselves, as
  demonstrated by Welbourne <em>et al.</em> (2019).
</p>
<p>
  For amphibians, camera traps set to capture time lapse images, or a
  combination of sensor triggered and time lapse images have been successfully
  used to monitor movements (Pagnucco <em>et al.</em> 2011), and describe
  activity patterns and behaviour (Hoffman <em>et al.</em> 2010; Engbrecht and
  Lannoo 2012), including for a rare and elusive micro-endemic frog species
  strictly dependent on bromeliads (Barata <em>et al.</em> 2018).
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, the target animals influence several study design considerations
  of camera trap surveys, meaning suitable ecological research is critical to a
  well-designed study (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012). If possible, rigorous,
  species-specific testing should be undertaken to complement the use of
  well-regarded camera trap models and general deployment recommendations
  (Seidlitz <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p style="color: blue">Camera trap point selection and preparation</p>
<p>
  When choosing the exact location for a camera trap point, careful attention to
  where the camera trap is located and to site preparation can improve
  detection, facilitate species identification and significantly reduce the
  incidences of false triggers. On approaching the camera trap point, look for a
  suitable place to set the camera trap (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Look
  for signs of fauna (e.g. tracks, scats) and features with a good chance of
  animal visitation (e.g. animal trails, creek banks, dry creek beds, narrow
  gullies, edges of dense vegetation, paths to water). Consider the target
  species or suite of species and their travel habits, the likely path of
  travel, the sensor’s range and field of view, and the terrain. Select the
  location that is likely to detect your target species or yield the greatest
  number of images of a suite of species, depending on the aims of your project
  (TEAM Network 2011b).
</p>
<p>
  An ideal location is a flat or gently sloping area that is relatively clear of
  shrubs and ground vegetation, but is shaded by trees or rock over-hangs. If
  deploying camera traps in a rocky or densely vegetated habitat, think
  carefully how fauna might access the point; if access is limited then this
  will influence the detection probability (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Set the ‘stage’ for the camera trap. Occasionally, terrain or vegetation can
  obstruct the detection zone. Remove vegetation as needed, considering windy
  conditions, to maximise detection within the field of view of the camera trap
  and minimise false triggers. Try to keep the stage as natural as possible,
  taking care not to disturb the area too much or create obstructions of cleared
  vegetation (TEAM Network 2011b).
</p>
<p>
  If using bait stations, it may be best to remove all vegetation around the
  bait station to ensure an uninterrupted view of fauna inspecting the bait and
  prevent false triggers. The vegetation around the base of the camera trap
  mount or tree to which the camera trap is attached to minimise the risk of
  fire damage to camera traps (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p style="color: blue">Mode of deployment</p>
<p>
  How a camera trap is deployed in the field (i.e. its height, angle, direction)
  can greatly improve detection probability and reduce false triggers. The
  detection zone of the PIR sensor in most camera traps is a wedge-shaped,
  horizontal band (or bands) spreading outwards from the front of the sensor. As
  a result, the detection zone increases in size with increasing distance from
  the sensor. Setting camera traps so that the sensor is at different heights
  above the ground and at different distances from the target area (e.g. a bait
  station) allows different sized fauna species to be targeted. Setting camera
  traps close to the ground (i.e. 15–20 cm), or higher and angled so that they
  point towards the ground, will record the greatest size range of animals, as
  sensors will be triggered by both smaller animals and the legs of larger
  animals. The camera trap’s field of view is more expansive vertically and
  generally wider than the sensor’s detection zone, so although only the legs of
  an animal may trigger the sensor the photograph will contain more of the
  animal. Detection zone area varies widely among camera trap models (see Meek
  et al. 2012). Camera traps with a narrow detection zone (i.e. smaller than the
  camera field of view) have usually fast trigger speeds and will take the photo
  when the animal is well within the field of view (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  When targeting large animals, such as kangaroos, camera traps should be set so
  that the sensor is at the height of the animal’s shoulder (e.g. approximately
  1 m above the ground). This will reduce the number of images of smaller
  non-target species, as these animals will be underneath the detection zone
  (Figure 4). A maximum distance of 5 m between the camera trap and the target
  area (e.g. a trail along which an animal may be walking) should allow adequate
  illumination and reduce the likelihood of animals being obscured by vegetation
  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  For medium-sized animals (e.g. quolls, bandicoots, possums), the camera trap
  should be set so that the sensor is approximately 50 cm above the ground
  (Figure 4). A distance of 3 m between the camera and the target area (e.g.
  bait station) will ensure the animal is in the foreground of the photograph
  and is clearly illuminated by the flash (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). For
  example, for bandicoots, camera traps are deployed approximately 50 cm above
  ground level in locations with evidence of recent diggings or suitable
  habitat, with inaccessible bait stations with rolled oats, honey and peanut
  butter (5:1:2 ratio; truffle oil optional at 20 ml/kg) bait attractant set up
  1–3 m in front of each camera trap. Vegetation is removed to ground level
  between the camera trap and bait station and within 1 m around the bait
  station if necessary (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚ Water‚
  Population and Communities 2011).
</p>
<p>
  For small mammals, studies have found that a sensor height of approximately
  20–30 cm above the ground, or downward facing camera traps increase detection
  (Welbourne <em>et al.</em> 2015; Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017; Dundas
  <em>et al.</em> 2019; Seidlitz <em>et al.</em> 2020). When targeting small
  mammals set the remote camera close to the target area (e.g. 1.5 m between the
  camera and bait station). Although small mammals are detected by remote
  cameras targeting medium-sized mammals, setting the camera close to the target
  area will capture the fine detail required for identifying certain small
  mammal species (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Setting camera traps to optimise detection of a wide range of species requires
  a balanced approach; there is no one size fits all. One option is to maximise
  the sensor sensitivity and the picture frame; set the camera up so that it is
  angled down towards a feature or bait station such that the field of view
  covers an area of ground from the foreground of the feature or bait station
  within 1.5 m of the camera trap to several metres beyond the feature or bait
  station. For single camera deployments, the bait station to camera distance
  should be 2.5 m. However, by deploying multiple cameras at a site, variable
  setups can also be incorporated, such as varying the bait station distance
  from 1.5 – 2.5 m (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  For predators including cats, foxes and dogs, camera traps should be placed 30
  cm from a road or track edge, 50 cm above the ground, set parallel to the
  ground (although this may vary depending on topography), oriented 23° to the
  road or track and facing away from the sun’s path, facing south and in shade
  is optimal. The detection point should be 4–6 m from the camera trap in the
  middle of the road or track. Rock outcrops, reflective surfaces and shadows in
  the field of view should be avoided, as well as vegetation close enough that
  it can blow into the field of view (Meek 2018).
</p>
<p>
  Camera traps should be set so that they are facing south to prevent false
  triggers from sun glare and shadowing, and minimise sun damage to the camera
  lens and sensor. Avoid deploying with east and west-facing orientations to
  reduce false triggers from the rising and setting of the sun. If using a tree
  to mount a camera trap, select a solid tree that will not move in the wind
  (diameter greater than 20 cm), with a relatively straight trunk and with a
  clear area to the south to direct the camera trap (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015).

<p style="color: blue">Camera trap settings</p>
<p>
  Three adjustable settings are common to many remote camera traps that can be
  used to ensure animals are captured, false triggers are minimized, and camera
  traps remain operational for the duration of a deployment: (i) motion sensor
  sensitivity; (ii) activation time; and (iii) camera delay (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Adjusting the sensitivity of the PIR sensor changes the sensor responsiveness
  by changing the heat sensitivity threshold, therefore being responsive to the
  temperature differential between an animal and the background environment
  required to trigger the camera. Because this heat difference is larger in cold
  temperatures, PIR sensors are more sensitive in temperate environments or
  during cooler seasons. High sensitivity is typically better to detect
  small-sized mammals. Reducing the sensitivity may also help avoid the problem
  of false triggers during the day due to heated vegetation, passing shadows or
  heated ground. However, by reducing the sensitivity there is a risk that some
  animals may not trigger the camera, especially in warm environments
  experienced in many parts of northern Australia where there is less difference
  between an animal’s body temperature and that of its surroundings. For cameras
  with SD cards that have the capacity to retain large numbers of images on a
  single set of batteries, large numbers of false triggers are less problematic
  and the maximum sensitivity setting is recommended to avoid missing animals
  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, the data storage and processing
  implications of this need to be considered.
</p>
<p>
  Activation time settings allow camera traps to be set to operate continuously,
  only at night, or only during the day. Some camera traps can also be
  programmed to operate between particular times (e.g., 0500–0800 hours). When
  targeting species that are strictly nocturnal, setting the camera trap for
  night operation only will eliminate many false trigger events during the day
  and reduce the number of images of non-target species. Reliable knowledge of
  the activity patterns of the target species and testing of cameras to
  determine the level of light required will aid in determining whether this is
  an appropriate setting for nocturnal animals that may also be active at dawn
  and dusk (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Many camera traps include a feature that allows for a pause (e.g., 15, 30
  seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes) between successive triggers. This will reduce
  the number of photographs taken of the same animal (e.g., if animals linger
  for long periods at bait stations) and may be useful in areas where there are
  very high levels of animal activity, especially of non-target species (e.g.,
  where macropods are common). The appropriate length of the delay will depend
  largely on the target species; a minimal delay will maximize the chances of
  obtaining multiple photographs of rare or cryptic species, while a longer
  delay would be appropriate when targeting slower moving animals that may
  travel in groups, such as macropods or feral herbivores (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Trigger speed (i.e., the speed with which a camera trap captures an image
  relative to when the sensor detects the animal) can be adjusted in some camera
  trap models. If available, this function can be useful for optimising
  detection of different species that may move through the field of view at
  different speeds, without the need for purchasing different camera trap models
  with different trigger speeds. Multiple trigger options in some camera traps,
  such as Reconyx, allow programming of camera traps to capture several images
  in quick succession each time the camera trap is triggered. This capability
  increases the likelihood of multiple images of the same animal, aiding in
  accurate species identification. The flash range is adjustable in some camera
  traps via the shutter speed setting (e.g., Reconyx). A slow shutter increases
  the flash range but also increases the potential for a blurry image. A fast
  shutter reduces flash range but results in a cleaner image. For smaller and
  faster moving animals, a faster shutter is recommended (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  Time lapse settings allow programming the camera trap to take photos at
  predetermined time intervals, without being triggered. This function may be
  useful for recording the presence of species that do not readily trigger
  infra-red sensors, such as amphibians and invertebrates (Hoffman
  <em>et al.</em> 2010; Pagnucco <em>et al.</em> 2011; Engbrecht and Lannoo
  2012; Barata <em>et al.</em> 2018; Potter <em>et al.</em> 2021), or for
  monitoring ecological processes, such as plant phenology (Kim
  <em>et al.</em> 2021). Some camera traps can also be set to capture video when
  they are triggered, which may be useful in behavioural studies (Hoffman
  <em>et al.</em> 2010; Krauss <em>et al.</em> 2018), distinguishing sympatric
  species (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017), or individual identification in
  mark-recapture studies (Mattioli <em>et al.</em> 2018).
</p>
<p style="color: blue">Attractant</p>
<p>
  Camera trap surveys often use lures to attract fauna into the detection zone
  of camera traps, thereby maximising the likelihood of detection. This is
  particularly important when targeting wide ranging species that occur at low
  densities and that do not use predictable travel routes or habitats where
  camera traps can be deployed. Without the attractive effects of a lure, the
  likelihood that such species will happen to pass by the camera trap and be
  detected may be very low (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, when using
  systematic camera trap arrays in surveys of occupancy and relative abundance,
  which rely on assumptions of equal detectability (Burton
  <em>et al.</em> 2015), lures should not be used to attract fauna to the camera
  trap points (TEAM Network 2011b; Meek 2018).
</p>
<p>
  Lures can be edible (i.e. baits which may also have an attractive scent),
  olfactory (i.e. scent), auditory (i.e. sound) or visual. Common lures used to
  attract feral cats include baits (fresh chicken coated with fish oil),
  auditory lures (Feline Audio Phonic, Westcare Industries, Perth, WA,
  Australia), and scent lures (Catastrophic, a proprietary product developed by
  Outfoxed Pest Control, Melbourne, VIC, Australia) (Stokeld
  <em>et al.</em> 2015). Visual attractants, consisting of a white and pink
  feathers and a shiny compact disk to appeal to cat hunting instincts and
  increase the ability of a cat to detect the lure station, are often used in
  association with other types of lures (Bengsen <em>et al.</em> 2011). Stokeld
  <em>et al.</em> (2015) found no evidence that feral cats in northern Australia
  are more attracted to any of these specific bait types.
</p>
<p>
  When using baits, the choice of bait depends on the food preferences of the
  species being targeted. When targeting carnivores, meat baits have generally
  been used in Australia, including chunks of raw chicken, kangaroo, rabbit or
  fish (e.g. pilchards, tuna log, perforated tins of cat food) and fish oil.
  However, meat and fish can putrefy very quickly, which may in fact act as a
  deterrent to some species. A standard mammal trapping bait mix of peanut
  butter, rolled oats and honey has been successfully used in surveys targeting
  a wide variety of small- and medium-sized native mammals, such as quolls,
  bandicoots, possums and rodents (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). A number of
  manufactured, lethal baits are commercially available for vertebrate pest
  management (e.g. FOXOFF®, FOXECUTE®, DOGABAIT®, CUROSITY®, Animal Control
  Technologies (Australia), Somerton, VIC, Australia), and these may serve as
  lures for camera trap studies targeting these species.
</p>
<p>
  Placing baits and olfactory lures inside containers that allow airflow (e.g.
  small cages, tea infusers, perforated PVC pipes) suspended above the ground
  will protect them from removal by target and non-target species, and ensure
  that their attractiveness persists for as long as possible. Species including
  corvids, rodents, dingoes, and ants can interfere severely with baits.
  Attaching the bait container to a pole (e.g. star picket, wooden stake)
  secures it and provides greater flexibility in positioning of the bait in
  relation to the camera trap. Ants can be deterred by spreading dust or
  granular insecticide for ants around the base of the pole (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  The NT Flora and Fauna Division has devised a bait container that is suitable
  for most baits and deployments and can be quickly constructed from readily
  available materials. The bait container is constructed using a short (80 mm)
  length of 50 mm PVC pipe with a wire-mesh ventilated end cap, an overhanging
  cover on the top and slit-ventilated bottom cap. The plumbing descriptions for
  the end caps are ‘vent water/insect proof PVC 50 mm’ for the top and ‘vent
  insect proof PVC 50 mm’ for the bottom (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p style="color: blue">Number and density of cameras</p>
<p>
  The number of camera trap points, whether single or multiple camera traps are
  allocated per camera trap point, the distance between camera trap points, the
  spatial coverage of a sampling unit, and the total survey area are all
  important considerations for camera trapping studies. An adequate number of
  camera trap points is required to ensure the sampling effort can reliably
  detect an effect relative to the total survey area. When determining this
  number, the desired levels of accuracy and precision must be considered
  relative to other influential factors, such as the increasing cost of
  deployment with each camera trap and the heterogeneity of the study area (Meek
  <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Table 3 outlines a rough guide to the minimum number
  of camera trap points with a single camera trap for occupancy surveys based on
  how common or rare and detectable a species is (Gillespie
  <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  The daily detection probability of the camera traps and the number of repeat
  surveys that are carried out at each camera trap point (i.e. the number of
  camera trap nights) should also be considered when determining the number of
  camera trap points. In general, surveying more camera trap points a greater
  number of times using the camera trap settings and deployment mode with the
  highest probability of detection, will maximise the precision of the estimate
  of the rate of occupancy. However, there are usually conflicts and trade-offs
  between these three aims. For example, if limited numbers of camera traps are
  available for use on a particular project, then carrying out many days of
  survey at each camera trap point will limit the total number of points which
  can be surveyed over the course of a survey season. The expected precision
  associated with a particular sampling program can be calculated if reasonable
  estimates regarding the occupancy rate amongst the sampled camera trap points
  and probability of detection are available prior to the survey. This
  information may be available from a previous study of the same species, from
  pilot studies, or from expert opinion (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  The distance between camera trap points, or camera trap spacing, will vary
  depending on the ecology of the target species and needs to be properly scaled
  to suitably sample the target species and ensure the independence of
  observations at adjacent camera trap points. The home ranges of target species
  should be considered and reported. More widely spaced camera traps will be
  appropriate for wide-ranging animals with large home ranges, while closer
  spacing is generally more suitable for species with smaller home ranges
  (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Where camera trap points are in a regular
  grid or transect, as in the array protocol, distance between cameras can be
  recorded as a single value. However, where camera trap points are randomly or
  irregularly located, as in the targeted protocol, the average, minimum and
  maximum distance among the points along with a measure of the distribution of
  distances (e.g. standard deviation) should be recorded. For the latter, the
  survey area can be defined by calculating the areas enclosed by either the
  concave or convex perimeter of camera trap points (Meek
  <em>et al.</em> 2014a).
</p>
<p>
  Where multiple species are being surveyed, detection bias needs to be
  considered as it is difficult to achieve an optimal camera trap spacing for a
  suite of species, and you are likely to end up with increased detection
  probability for some species and decreased detection probability for others
  (Harmsen <em>et al.</em> 2010; Foster and Harmsen 2012; Mann
  <em>et al.</em> 2015). Studies assessing the species richness of terrestrial
  mammals vary considerably in camera trap spacing, including &lt;1 km (Trolle
  and Kéry 2005; Di Bitetti <em>et al.</em> 2014; Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018), 1
  km (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018), 1.5 km (Silveira <em>et al.</em> 2003), 2 km
  (Tobler <em>et al.</em> 2008; Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018) and varied spacing
  between 1.75 and &gt;5 km within the same study area (Srbek-Araujo and
  Chiarello 2013). Arrays of 20–30 camera traps at a density of one camera trap
  per 2 km<sup>2</sup> are used to monitor changes in the community of
  ground-dwelling, terrestrial vertebrates in tropical regions (TEAM Network
  2011b), whereas a robust predator monitoring program will often have at least
  20–30 camera traps spaced approximately 1 km apart (Meek 2018).
</p>
<p>
  Deploying more than one camera trap at each sampling location, as in the fauna
  plot protocol, will usually be expected to lead to an increase in the
  probability of detecting a species (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Deploying
  multiple camera traps per camera trap point in an array may also be useful to
  determine occupancy, detectability and power to monitor population change of
  species among micro-habitats (e.g. monitoring feral cats and foxes on- and
  off-road; Geyle <em>et al.</em> 2020), or to assess the influence of camera
  trap placement relative to a grid point based on the number and type of animal
  signs (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018).

<p style="color: blue">Deployment period</p>
<p>
  The deployment period of camera traps determines how many daily replicate
  samples are collected (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2014a), with datasets improving
  with increasing deployment periods (Kays et al 2009). This variable has been
  found to be a more important factor than camera trap spacing and microsite
  placement at grid points in providing accurate species richness estimates
  (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2018). Ultimately, the optimal deployment time will
  depend on your target species, meaning further research should be undertaken
  to adequately prepare for your survey (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012).
</p>
<p>
  A common camera trap deployment period is 2–4 weeks (Kays
  <em>et al.</em> 2011). However, how common or rare a species is in the
  landscape and the detection probability will affect decisions around the
  deployment period of camera traps (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). In some
  cases, including where the number of camera trap points sampled is more
  important for analysis than deployment period (Kays <em>et al.</em> 2011), or
  during a pilot study to confirm that traps can adequately detect certain
  species and allow accurate identification (Meek and Vernes 2015), camera traps
  may be deployed for less than 2 weeks. However, the minimum recommended
  deployment period of camera traps to monitor small- and medium-sized mammals
  in Australia is 14 nights (Paull <em>et al.</em> 2011). A deployment period of
  30 nights for each of 20–30 camera traps is used to monitor changes in the
  community of ground-dwelling, terrestrial vertebrates in tropical regions
  (TEAM Network 2011b). Similarly, camera traps are recommended to be deployed
  for a minimum period of four weeks to monitor predators (Meek 2018).
</p>
<p>
  Table 3 outlines a rough guide to the minimum number of weeks to deploy camera
  traps for occupancy surveys based on how common or rare and detectable a
  species is (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Whereas Table 4 outlines the
  estimated deployment periods required to achieve a detection probability
  &gt;0.7 for feral cats using 2–5 camera traps placed in and around a 50 x 50 m
  fauna plot. At each plot, five camera traps were deployed in a diamond
  configuration, with a single camera trap in the centre and four camera traps
  placed 30–100 m from the centre point (Stokeld <em>et al.</em> 2015). The
  camera trap layouts for the Fauna plot protocol are similar to those used by
  Stokeld <em>et al.</em> (2015), but have been adapted to align with the 100 x
  100 m fauna plot (see Appendix A).
</p>
<p>
  The maximum camera trap deployment period is also usually limited by battery
  life or the storage capacity of SD cards. If camera traps are not required for
  use at other camera trap points, then deploying camera traps for a length of
  time close to the expected endurance of the batteries and/or SD card storage
  capacity is a good strategy. This is because the cost of leaving a deployed
  camera trap out for a few extra days is effectively zero – no additional staff
  time or resources are required for a 30-day deployment for example, compared
  to a 10-day deployment. By maximising the length of the deployments, a greater
  effective number of daily replicate samples are collected at each camera trap
  point, and hence a longer sequence of detection and non-detection events is
  accumulated at each point. Statistically, this leads to more precise
  estimation of both the probability of detection and the rate of occupancy.
  When either the number of camera trap points or number of replicate samples is
  increased the precision of the occupancy estimates improves. However, the
  improvement in the estimate is far better when the number of camera trap
  points surveyed is increased (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).

<p style="color: blue">Storage and transport</p>
<p>
  Camera traps should be stored in a safe location and transported in sealed,
  padded containers to prevent accidental damage, water damage, dust damage and
  theft (Gillespie et al. 2015). When packing the camera traps to take in the
  field do not store them with food or any other substances that might leave an
  odour on the camera trap. Food or other scents might attract fauna to the
  camera trap in the field, biasing the estimates of detection probability. Do
  not carry camera traps and food in the same bag when walking to camera trap
  points. An open backpack frame to which the camera traps can be strapped is a
  practical solution to carry camera traps in the field (TEAM Network 2011b).
</p>
<p style="color: blue">Permits and ethics</p>
<p>
  A key feature of remote cameras, in contrast to many other wildlife survey
  techniques, is that they are relatively non-invasive; animals don’t need to be
  physically captured or handled as part of the survey. From an ethical and
  animal welfare point of view, remote camera surveys are only minimally
  intrusive, with impacts on animals limited to minor disturbance caused by
  flashes and camera noise, and behavioural responses to baits and minor habitat
  disturbance. For these reasons, animal ethics approvals may still be required
  for implementing remote camera surveys (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 2015).
</p>
<p>
  You should contact the relevant animal ethics committee to ensure you have the
  required animal ethics approvals well in advance of your field survey. You
  will need to consider how often the animal ethics committee meets and the
  timeframe for approvals to be granted. It is also wise to allow time to
  address any queries from the committee or conditions that must be met prior to
  an approval being granted.
</p>
<p style="color: blue">
  <strong>Camera trap preparation and calibration</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Camera traps</em> module depends on the camera traps being in proper
  functioning order, so taking adequate care and maintenance of the camera traps
  essential. To ensure the highest possible quality and integrity of the data,
  close attention must be paid to preparing and calibrating the camera traps
  before they are deployed in the field. Preparations should be started no later
  than 1 week before a field survey (TEAM Network 2011b).
</p>
<p style="color: blue">Camera trap identification</p>
<p>
  Before camera traps are deployed in the field they need to be allocated and
  marked with an identification number. Camera traps should also be registered
  in an equipment management database to keep track of their location (e.g. in
  storage, assigned to project RLP001), current firmware, and operational status
  (e.g. functional, damaged; TEAM Network 2011b).
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Clearly mark each camera trap externally with a unique identification
      number (e.g. 01, 02, 03) using a permanent, water resistant marker.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Retrieve the serial number of each camera trap from the white sticker
      underneath the control panel.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the <em>Camera trap number</em> and <em>Serial number</em> of each
      camera trap in an equipment management database (e.g. spreadsheet). Other
      data you may wish to record includes the camera trap <em>Make</em>,
      <em>Model</em>, <em>Purchase</em><em>date</em>, <em>Firmware</em>,
      <em>Operational</em><em>status</em> and <em>Current location</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="color: blue">Camera trap firmware update</p>
<p>
  Camera trap manufacturers regularly provide firmware updates for their camera
  traps. Ensure you check the relevant website for updates and instructions for
  updating before each field survey or camera trap redeployment. As an example,
  the steps to update the firmware on Reconyx camera traps, which are used in
  the Fauna plot protocol, are provided below (Bush Heritage Australia 2021).
</p>
<p style="color: orange">Reconyx firmware updates</p>
<ol type="1">

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check the list of Reconyx camera trap models for the relevant update.
      HC500, HC550, HC600 and PC850 models generally all have the same update.

</p>
<p style="color: orange">Fauna plot protocol camera settings</p>
<p>
  The fauna plot protocol uses Reconyx camera traps with a standardized settings
  configuration. Although Reconyx camera traps have some pre-programmed ‘QUICK
  SET’ settings configurations, these can vary between models. Therefore, you
  must configure the settings for the fauna plot protocol using the ‘ADVANCED’
  menu. The following settings are required to maximise the likelihood of
  detections in the fauna plot protocol. It is noted that by increasing the
  likelihood of detection you also increase the likelihood of false triggers.
  However, explicit site preparation techniques and camera trap placement and
  orientation in the field are used to reduce the likelihood of false triggers.

<p style="color: blue">SD cards</p>
<p style="color: orange">SD card selection</p>
<p>
  A Secure Digital<sup>®</sup> (SD) card is required to store the images and
  video your camera trap captures. SD cards have various storage capacities and
  reading and writing speeds. Larger capacity cards are capable of storing more
  images and video. Several factors will influence your required storage
  capacity, including deployment period, target species, site conditions,
  selected image quality and whether you are capturing video. Most users find
  that 4GB or 8GB cards are more than adequate for general use, with capacity to
  store between approximately 4,000 and 8,000 3.1MP images, respectively. You
  may want to consider a larger storage capacity if camera traps are being
  deployed for a long period, the risk of false triggers is high, or you are
  capturing video. Ensure you check the maximum capacity SD card that your
  camera traps will accept.
</p>
<p>
  SD cards with higher speed ratings are capable of reading and writing images
  faster, which is particularly advantageous when capturing RapidFire image
  sequences. Speed Class 10 SD cards, which are capable of high reading and
  writing speeds with a minimum write speed of 10MB/s, are recommend. It is also
  recommended that you purchase two SD cards per camera trap, so they can be
  easily swapped when redeploying camera traps.
</p>
<p style="color: orange">SD card identification</p>
<p>
  Before SD cards are used in camera traps that are deployed in the field, they
  need to be allocated and marked with an identification number. Similar to
  camera traps, SD cards should also be registered in an equipment management
  database to keep track of their location (e.g. in storage, assigned to project
  RLP001, assigned to camera 01), (e.g. functional, damaged; TEAM Network
  2011b).
</p>
<ol type="1">

<p style="color: orange">SD card formatting</p>
<p>
  Formatting an SD card effectively erases all the card data, giving you a
  fresh, empty folder structure to work with. After you have backed up your SD
  card after each field survey, you should format each SD card before the next
  field survey. This will ensure data from different surveys is not mixed up.
  Furthermore, regular formatting of SD cards can lower the risk of corrupt
  files.

    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="color: blue">Batteries</p>
<p>
  Each camera trap can require up 12 AA batteries depending on the make and
  model. Batteries should be selected after consulting the user manual of the
  camera traps you are using and consideration of your study requirements. The
  three most common battery types used are Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH), lithium
  and alkaline. Longer lasting batteries such as rechargeable NiMH and lithium
  batteries are preferred over alkaline batteries (TEAM Network 2011b), which
  tend to discharge quicker and also suffer in extreme cold weather (Meek
  <em>et al.</em> 2012).
</p>
<p>
  Rechargeable and lithium batteries have similar upfront costs (excluding
  chargers). However, rechargeable batteries are a better long-term option and
  recommended for their reliability, longevity, and sustainability. In
  Australia, Eneloop and Eneloop Pro batteries are good quality and have been
  recommended by experts (Meek <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is common practice to
  have two complete sets of rechargeable batteries per camera trap, which
  enables the seamless redeployment of camera traps within and between studies.
  Instructions for preparing rechargeable batteries for the field are outlined
  below (TEAM Network 2011b).
</p>
<p style="color: orange">Rechargeable NiMH battery preparation</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      If charging the batteries for the first time, or the first time for a
      given field season, put them in a discharging-recharging cycle
      (conditioning cycle) at least 48 hours before leaving for the field. This
      ensures that the battery “memory” is properly set and prolongs the life of
      the rechargeable battery. Refer to the battery charger for instructions to
      put the batteries into a condition cycle. Only use battery chargers that
      have this specification. Depending on the number of camera traps you have,
      multiple large battery chargers may be required to be used in parallel to
      prepare for the field.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If not charging the batteries for the first time, discharge them first and
      recharge them for at least 24 hours before leaving for the field survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once the batteries are finished charging, check they have adequate voltage
      using a voltmeter. Rechargeable batteries will show a lower voltage than
      their posted voltage of 1.5 V, but this is normal for these battery types
      (between 1.25 and 1.3 V).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Try not to charge the batteries more than 2–3 days before taking them into
      the field.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Within 1–2 days of the field survey, insert the charged batteries into
      each camera trap so they are ready for the survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Do not use the rechargeable batteries prepared for the field survey to
      configure the camera trap settings (see below). Use a spare set of
      batteries.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="color: blue">Desiccant</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      If the camera traps are being deployed in humid or wet conditions, place a
      packet of desiccant (silica gel) inside each camera trap housing to help
      protect the electronics from moisture.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="color: blue"><strong>Camera trap array preparation</strong></p>
<p>
  Prior to a field survey using the array protocol, an initial desktop exercise
  using species information, satellite imagery and GIS spatial data layers,
  along with any other information relevant to the project, is required to
  establish and geo-reference a camera trap array (i.e. a systematic grid or
  transect/s of camera trap points). Decisions on the camera trap array should
  be based on the best available biological and geographical information (see
  Table 5).
</p>
<p>
  Compile the essential GIS spatial data layers prior to the generation of the
  camera trap array (Table 5). These layers will contribute to an accurate
  assessment of optimal placement of the camera trap array within the project
  area.
</p>
<p>
  The broad-scale locations of camera trap points (e.g. 1 km spacing) are
  established and geo-referenced through the desktop assessment process, and
  loaded into the App on the mobile device. Fine-scale camera trap locations,
  within close proximity (e.g. 20 m) to the broad-scale locations, are
  determined in the field based on suitable camera trap placement locations to
  maximise detection of the target fauna.

      Review available satellite imagery, vegetation mapping and other GIS
      spatial data layers (e.g. access tracks, soil, landform, watercourses,
      land-use) to ensure the proposed camera trap array is practicable. Factors
      such as poor accessibility (i.e. few tracks, difficult terrain, dense
      vegetation) can limit the camera trap array design.

<p style="color: blue"><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Obtain a background source image. This will typically be a Landsat
      satellite image and should be the most recent date freely available.
      Satellite imagery will be the first building block in determining the
      extent of spatially appropriate areas to deploy camera traps in an array.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Identify major access routes. These should include a good quality road or
      track along which a vehicle can travel into or through the project area
      (see Figure 7B). Create a buffer of at least 100 m to avoid camera trap
      points being placed within this designated proximity of a major access
      routes and/or roads.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Identify minor access routes. These can include any walking trail systems
      or old landholder tracks within the project area, specifically adjacent or
      located along the major access routes identified above. Create a buffer of
      at least 100 m to avoid camera trap points being placed within this
      designated proximity to existing minor access routes and/or trail systems.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When generating a camera trap array, consider the need to minimise
      disturbance of the project area associated with accessing each camera trap
      point. Identify existing tracks and trails, as well as passages that may
      be suitable for temporary access routes. Consider if temporary access
      routes are required to undertake other modules and if these can be
      combined with camera trap array temporary access routes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Verify that the camera trap arrays will be accessible during the entire
      proposed deployment period (e.g. a property owner might close off a
      paddock/s for stocking reasons, limiting access).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify impenetrable areas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Overlay a land cover/vegetation map. It is helpful to be aware of a
      general distribution of vegetation types and these can be delineated from
      a vegetation mapping spatial dataset, a land cover map or satellite image
      and/or with local expertise.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Depending on the target fauna and habitat within the project area, you may
      wish to define a smaller study area within the project area, which is all
      that is needed to satisfy the objectives of your survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Depending on the target fauna and habitat within the project area, you may
      wish to stratify the study area and generate camera arrays within specific
      habitat areas.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Overlay topographic data. For the majority of project areas, the most
      readily available product will be a coarse SRTM-derived Digital Elevation
      Model (DEM) with a spatial resolution of 90 m. These data will provide an
      idea of significant changes in elevation. For some project areas, local
      topography maps may have been digitized or generated from other sources
      and may be available for the analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Determine if there is an elevation gradient. Analyse the DEM to ascertain
      if there are any significant elevation gradients evident (i.e. a
      difference of &gt;1000 m between lowest and highest elevations within the
      project area or study area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If there is a major altitudinal gradient within the project area or study
      area, you may consider generating multiple camera trapping grids or
      transects along this gradient (e.g. in three strata: low elevation, mid
      elevation and high elevation).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Identify rocky outcroppings by interpreting a satellite image. These areas
      may be digitised and then clipped out of the extent of the project area or
      study area before the camera trap array is generated.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Identify steep slopes that would prohibit traversing or sampling. To
      identify the slopes, derive a slope map from a DEM. Areas that are &gt;45
      degrees are masked out. Use this mask layer to omit those areas from the
      project area or study area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Identify seasonally inundated areas, big ponds, or streams that may be
      impassable during the proposed deployment period. If these areas are
      easily identifiable, they can be digitised directly from an up-to-date
      satellite image. It should be noted that identifying inundated areas,
      especially seasonally inundated areas, can be very difficult and that
      consulting an expert with local knowledge of the area is highly
      recommended.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Identify open areas, or large gaps that are unsuitable for sampling. These
      may be digitised directly from an up-to-date satellite image also or from
      assistance of local expert who has knowledge of the area. Also, it should
      be noted that some gaps, for example, may represent senescent vegetation
      and not gaps.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The broad-scale camera trap points uploaded into the App are merely a
      navigational guide to arrive within the general vicinity of the
      computer-generated camera trap points. It is required that an updated
      location (being the actual location of the camera trap point at the time
      of deployment) be collected by marking a new waypoint within reasonable
      proximity to the original proposed point (TEAM Network 2011a).

<p style="color: blue">Data upload, curation and submission</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once the mobile device has a data connection (i.e. WIFI or cellular),
      upload (by an explicit user action) all survey data on the App, including
      the project administration and camera trap survey metadata, to the staging
      database server for storage and curation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When back in the office, manually upload the image and/or video data using
      the extract, transform and load (ETL) import facility for these data
      items, which parses image and video data files and uploads them to the
      staging database. You will be prompted to select the relevant project
      number and enter the camera trap number and SD card number to tag the
      images and/or video files.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Alongside the staging database server is a relational database server and
      associated production database. This database is the ‘end-point’ of each
      survey upload and it houses the ‘final’ data products from all modules
      completed during that survey. A periodic ingestion script converts staged
      project administration data, camera trap survey metadata and image/video
      data into the production relational database that is populated with a set
      of data and lookup tables.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Data curation is undertaken via the web-based view onto the production
      database and involves general checks and data cleaning (e.g. of free-text
      comments). The web-interface allows data to be viewed, for certain fields
      to be edited directly and provides search and retrieval functions for
      simple data extraction.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use the web-based view onto the production database to link the project
      administration data and camera trap survey metadata to the image and/or
      video data via the project number, camera trap number and SD card number.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When the data from the survey has been curated, it can be marked as ‘Ready

</ul>
<p style="color: blue">Image and video processing and tagging</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Tag each individual image and/or video clip with a <em>Media ID</em> and

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Images and/or video with fauna need to be tagged with the

      <em>Number of individuals</em>, <em>Identifier</em>,
      <em>Identification date</em> (update from processing date if necessary),
      <em>Identification confidence</em> (i.e. certain, uncertain),
      <em>Identification method</em> (e.g. AI, expert, citizen scientist), and

<p style="color: blue">Additional guidelines</p>
<p>
  The following points are adapted from Gillespie <em>et al.</em> (2015) and
  Molloy (2018).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Camera traps can collect large volumes of image and/or video data,
      particularly when arrays of cameras are deployed for weeks or months.
      Careful management and storage of data is needed to link media data to the
      corresponding camera trap and associated deployment metadata, and
      facilitate interpretation and data analyses. If possible, program the
      camera so that camera trap point name is added as a label to each image
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Images and/or video should not be deleted from an SD card until it has
      been checked that they have been downloaded successfully.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is good practice to keep a back-up copy of photos (i.e. on an external
      hard-drive) until processing has occurred.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once all data is downloaded and checked, a good practice is to clear all
      SD cards, preferably by formatting. This ensures that SD cards are working
      correctly and prevents full cards from being reloaded into camera traps in
      future deployments.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Processing the images and/or video collected from camera traps can be time
      consuming. Ensure that sufficient time has been factored into project
      timelines for data processing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It will be difficult to positively identify some species, especially from
      poor-quality images.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Familiarise yourself with the appearance, habitat and behaviour of the
      fauna that you are likely to encounter during your deployment.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In some cases, individual recognition of animals will be possible (i.e.
      those with distinct markings), but for most species it will only be
      possible to identify to the species rather than individual level.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Interpretation of camera trapping data requires that statistical analysis
      methods are applied to account for features of the data, in particular the
      likely presence of false negative occurrence records (i.e. species present
      in the project area but not detected).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      See Molloy (2018) for tips for processing large amounts of camera trap
      data manually.
