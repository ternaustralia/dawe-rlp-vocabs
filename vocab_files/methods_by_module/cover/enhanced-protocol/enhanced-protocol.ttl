<h1 id="additional-guidelines">Additional Guidelines</h1>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="efficiency">Efficiency</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Laying out a set of tape measures along multiple transects,
rather than one transect at a time, is more efficient. This is
particularly the case if the survey team comprises more generalist
surveyors and/or volunteers who can lay out the tapes while the
vegetation specialist commences the point-intercept transects.</p></li>
<li><p>Tape measures should ideally be labelled metrically on both sides
for ease of reading.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="rules-for-determining-what-is-a-hit">Rules
for determining what is a ‘hit’</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Where a part of a plant of the same species and growth form is
being intercepted at different heights, the uppermost intercept is
recorded as a hit and all lower intercepts are ignored. This includes
plants that are intercepted with the laser pointer, touching the staff
between the laser pointer and the densitometer, and/or intercepting the
vertical line of sight through the densitometer.</p></li>
<li><p>If part of a tree or shrub intersects the vertical line of sight
through the densitometer, this is recorded as a hit.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="enhanced-protocol-1">Enhanced Protocol</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>If you intercept a dead plant and can determine what the species
is, this is recorded as a hit for that species but flagged as
<em>dead</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you intercept a dead plant but you cannot determine what the
species is, this is recorded as an <em>annual forb</em>, <em>annual
grass</em> or <em>shrub/tree</em> (pre-recorded field names) and flagged
as <em>dead</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="standard-protocol-1">Standard Protocol</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>If you intercept a dead plant, this is a hit and recorded as
<em>non-photosynthetic vegetation</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="using-the-grs-densitometer">Using the GRS
Densitometer™</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure the graduated staff is adjusted so that the densitometer
is at eye-level.</p></li>
<li><p>Level both of the densitometer bubble-levels and then look
through the instrument so that the sighting marks (cross hairs and
circle) are aligned.</p></li>
<li><p>If working in bright sunlight, a piece of coloured cellophane can
be placed over the top of the densitometer and secured with a rubber
band to reduce glare.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="in-canopy-sky">In canopy sky</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a> illustrates when to apply <em>in canopy sky</em>
(ICS).</p></li>
<li><p>Where the vertical line of sight through the densitometer
projects onto bare sky that is fully enclosed within a canopy, ICS is
recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the vertical line of sight through the densitometer
projects onto bare sky that is not within a canopy, nothing is
recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>The canopy perimeter (from an aerial or vertical perspective) is
the extent of the outer layer of leaves of an individual tree or
shrub.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="enhanced-protocol-2">Enhanced Protocol</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Where the vertical line of sight through the densitometer
projects onto bare sky that is within the canopy of a dead tree and you
can determine what the species is, ICS is recorded for that species but
flagged as <em>dead</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the vertical line of sight through the densitometer
projects onto bare sky that is within the canopy of a dead tree, but you
cannot determine what the species is, ICS is recorded for a
<em>shrub/tree</em> (pre-recorded field name) and flagged as
<em>dead</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="standard-protocol-2">Standard protocol</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Where the vertical line of sight through the densitometer
projects onto bare sky that is within the canopy of a live tree, this is
a hit and recorded as <em>photosynthetic vegetation</em> and flagged as
<em>in canopy sky</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the vertical line of sight through the densitometer
projects onto bare sky that is within the canopy of a dead tree, this is
not a hit and nothing is recorded for the canopy.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="estimating-tree-height">Estimating tree
height</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Tree height should ideally be estimated using a forestry
rangefinder for rapid and accurate height measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>When using a rangefinder, the distance and the angle to the top
of the tree are measured at the same time, and then the distance angle
to the base of the tree are measured at the same time. The internal
calculator will then calculate the height. Ensure you are far enough
from the tree, at least the distance of the height of the tree, and can
see the top and base of the tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Where a rangefinder is not available, tree height can be
estimated using the following methods:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Clinometer and tape</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile phone applications</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>When using a clinometer and tape, find a place to stand where you
can see the top of the tree. Your distance from the tree should at least
be equal to the height of the tree. Measure the distance between
yourself and the tree and measure the height from your eye to the
ground. Look through the clinometer with one eye and at the tree with
the other eye. Line up the crosshair in the clinometer with the top of
the tree. Read the value on the percent scale. This gives you the tree's
height as a percentage of the distance from the tree (e.g. a reading of
50% means the height of the tree is half the distance you are from the
tree).</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Calculate the height of the tree using the equation:</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tree height = clinometer reading / 100 x distance to tree +
eye height</em></p></li>
<li><p>On sloping ground, two readings will need to be taken: treetop
(reading 1) and tree base (reading 2). When the surveyor is standing
above the level of the tree base, the two percent values are added.
Calculate the height of the tree using the equation:</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tree height = (clinometer reading 1 + clinometer reading 2) /
100 x distance to tree</em></p></li>
<li><p>When the surveyor is standing below the level of the tree base,
the tree base percent is subtracted from the treetop percent. Calculate
the height of the tree using the following equation:</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tree height = (clinometer reading 1 - clinometer reading 2) /
100 x distance to tree</em></p></li>
<li><p>See <a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a> for diagrams of using a clinometer in each
situation.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>There are several mobile phone applications that provide an
estimate of tree height. Like the clinometer guidelines above, a
measurement of the distance to the tree is required to estimate the
height.</p></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Point-intercept surveys are best conducted with two personnel,
one making the point-intercept<br/>
observations, and the other recording the data directly into the app and
assisting with tree height<br/>
measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor that conducted the Floristics Module should be
involved to ensure consistent nomenclature.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor making the observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying the<br/>
characteristic identifiable features of flora species and how to
distinguish one species from another. If surveyors are not confident,
time should be dedicated to practising, using field reference guides,
and seeking advice before conducting this protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Point-intercept surveys do not involve interference with
vegetation or wildlife. Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife
ethics approvals are unlikely to be required but always check with your
local authority. Access permissions are required.</p></li>
</ul>
    <h3 id="instructions-and-procedures">Instructions and procedures</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ensure the Plot Selection and Layout Module has been completed to
mark out the plot boundary and define the current plot and visit in the
Monitor App.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the Floristics Module has been completed so that species
cover data are recorded using naming consistent with the flora species
identifications/assigned field names recorded in the Floristics
Module.</p></li>
<li><p>For each transect lay out a 100 m tape using pegs to secure it in
place (<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>), ensuring the tape is orientated to align with the plot
grid, is as straight as possible, and laid on the ground and not draped
over shrubs.</p>

<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Move to the 0 m mark of the first transect you wish to complete.
It does not matter which order, or which direction each transect is
completed, as your start position will be recorded in step 6.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the Cover Module and then <em>Enhanced</em>
<em>protocol</em> in the Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>If undertaking the Fire Severity Module concurrently, tick the
<em>plot is burnt</em> check box and enter the ignition date. This will
reveal fire severity and resprouting fields for every intersect on the
four Standard protocol transects only (see the Fire Severity Module).
The <em>trunk char height</em> component will also appear below the
<em>point intercept</em> component in the Monitor app. Trunk char height
is recorded at the four locations where the four Standard protocol
transects intersect (see the Fire Severity Module).</p></li>
<li><p>Record your <em>starting point</em> (i.e. N1–5, S1–5, E1–5, or
W1–5). This records the <em>transect</em> you are on and the
<em>sampling direction</em> (e.g. ‘N1’ means you are starting at the
northern end of transect 1 and moving from north to south, while ‘S2’
means you are starting at the southern end of transect 2 and moving from
south to north).</p></li>
<li><p>Place the bottom of the staff at the 0 m mark of the tape
measure. Ensure the staff is vertical and the laser pointer is pointing
downwards so the laser beam will intercept the ground near the base of
the staff (<a href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a>).</p></li>
