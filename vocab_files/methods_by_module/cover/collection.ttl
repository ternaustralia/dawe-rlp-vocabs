<h2 id="available-protocols">Available Protocols</h2>
<p>This module includes two protocols for recording cover within the
plot:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/576f634e-2706-4f18-b561-0636d4c007d0">Enhanced protocol</a> – cover recorded from 1010 point-intercepts
across the plot for all intercepts from the ground to the canopy,
including substrate, species, growth form and height.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/aa1525f9-c3f2-4f7d-98cc-6a7d3aec9d8a">Standard protocol</a> – fractional cover recorded from 404
point-intercepts across the plot for all intercepts from the ground to
the canopy, including substrate, photosynthetic and non-photosynetic
vegetation, and height.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/576f634e-2706-4f18-b561-0636d4c007d0">Enhanced protocol</a> includes instructions and procedures for
setting up ten 100 m transects (5 x N/S and 5 x E/W), recording
point-intercept data, including substrate, species, growth form, height
and canopy data, at 1 m intervals along the ten transects (for a total
of 1010 points), and entering the data directly into the Monitor
app.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/aa1525f9-c3f2-4f7d-98cc-6a7d3aec9d8a">Standard protocol</a> includes instructions and procedures for
setting up four 100 m transects (2 x N/S and 2 x E/W) and recording
substrate, photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation, height and
canopy data at 1 m intervals along the four transects (for a total of
404 points).</p>
<p>The guidelines provide further information on using the GRS
Densitometer™ to view canopy intercepts, the rules for determining a
‘hit’, when to apply <em>in canopy sky</em> and measuring tree
heights.</p>
<p>Rainforests, tall eucalypt forests and vine thickets provide some
challenges to the use of the point-intercept method (Sparrow et al.
2020). This is because the identification and distinction of tall trees
can be difficult, and the vegetation in vine thickets can be too dense
to lay out and survey transects. Future development of EMSA protocols
will aim to investigate alternative plot sizes which will be more
suitable in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Vegetation cover is an essential variable for any ecological
assessment or monitoring program (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2013). It is
required for the study, analysis, reporting and management of ecosystem
condition, structure, and change. Substrate cover can be an important
measure for assessments of soil stabilisation, biological soil crusts,
erosion, litter heterogeneity, nutrient input and cycling, and
compressional disturbances (Andrew and Lange 1986a; Facelli and Carson
1991; Belnap and Gillette 1998; Shen <em>et al.</em> 2011; Li <em>et
al.</em> 2014).</p>
<p>The point-intercept method is the most repeatable and precise method
to assess vegetation cover for all strata (Vittoz and Guisan 2007;
Godínez-Alvarez <em>et al.</em> 2009; Bonham 2013). The method is
straightforward and allows for detailed spatial and temporal comparisons
of cover between plot samples with minimal uncertainty from measurement
method or observer variation (Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>
<p>The point-intercept method is preferred over visually estimating
cover using cover classes (e.g. Braun-Blanquet 1932), which can be
biased, imprecise and poor at detecting change (Vittoz and Guisan 2007;
Godínez-Alvarez <em>et al.</em> 2009). Observer error and variability is
minimised in the point-intercept method as surveyors objectively
determine which plants and substrates are intercepted at each point
(Vittoz and Guisan 2007; Clarke 2009). The use of cover classes in
visual estimates is problematic since classes are often too broad (e.g.
25-50%) to identify and analyse subtle changes in cover, limiting their
ability to identify more subtle environmental change. The transect
point-intercept method is favoured over other point-intercept methods
(e.g. wheel-point, step-pointing) as it is more straightforward, more
accurate, applicable in more systems and less prone to bias (Tidmarsh
and Havenga 1955; Evans and Love 1957; Walker 1970).</p>
<p>Several authors recommend a minimum of 1,000 point-intercepts to
quantify vegetation cover per species in rangeland environments (Lodge
and Gleeson 1976; Holm <em>et al.</em> 1984; Friedel and Shaw 1987;
Vittoz and Guisan 2007). Rangeland environments represent 81% of the
terrestrial ecosystems in Australia and include a diverse range of
habitats and ecological communities such as tropical savannas,
woodlands, shrublands and grasslands (Department of Agriculture‚ Water
and the Environment 2021). These factors are the basis for the Cover
Module’s Enhanced protocol sampling 1,010 point-intercepts to estimate
vegetation cover per species across the plot. The Enhanced protocol is
also based on the point-intercept protocol initiated in Australia’s
rangeland environments by the TERN Ecosystem Surveillance monitoring
program (White <em>et al.</em> 2012), which has since been implemented
successfully in a wide variety of structurally diverse vegetation
communities across the country (Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020).
Point-intercept data from program demonstrates that the number and
arrangement of point-intercepts employed is adequate for maximising
species detection and for stable estimation of cover becauseestimates of
species richness and cover become relatively stable by 1010 points
(Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>
<p>The Cover Module’s Standard protocol samples 404 point-intercepts.
However, vegetation cover per species is not reliable from 404 points
(i.e. cover estimates change quickly with the addition of
point-intercepts, while estimates stabilise with the full set of 1010
point-intercepts (Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2017)). For this reason, the
Standard protocol is not suitable for studies that require reliable
measures of cover per species, but is suitable for studies interested in
quantifying fractional cover. Data from 404 point-intercepts is
appropriate to detect overall change but can’t reliably identify what is
causing that change, unlike the Enhanced protocol.</p>
<p>Data is collected using a grid configuration (<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>), which is
less sensitive to the effects that local heterogeneity (e.g. due to
slope) and vegetation micro-patterning may have on estimates of cover
(Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020). Transect ends are at least initially
located and recorded, ideally with a GNSS device which ensures detection
of true environmental change rather than change due to the positioning
of the transects. The use of a densitometer (<a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>) ensures canopy
cover data is precise, objective and repeatable. The inclusion of ICS
allows for vegetation cover measures including opaque canopy cover and
projected foliage cover to be determined from the point-intercept data.
Such compatibility maximises the value of the point-intercept data,
allowing it to be integrated with other studies for both ecological and
remote sensing validation purposes.</p>
<p>The point-intercept method is designed to sample the composition and
structure of dominant vegetation to enable the determination of various
measures of cover (e.g. species, total vegetation). The method is not
designed for species detection (Stohlgren <em>et al.</em> 1998; Vittoz
and Guisan 2007; Nunes <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, the combination
of the Cover Module and the Floristics Module ensures adequate sampling
effort for plant species composition and cover (Sparrow <em>et al.</em>
2020).</p>
<p>Assigning a vegetation classification consistent with Level 5
(association) of the NVIS provides a simple, consistent description of
the vegetation and its structural complexity (White <em>et al.</em>
2012). The use of standardised methods to classify vegetation across a
range of different projects ensures consistent, cross jurisdictional
vegetation classification, improves vegetation classification in
data-poor areas, and allows comparison of data across regions, and under
different disturbance, management and climatic regimes (Guerin <em>et
al.</em> 2017; Baruch <em>et al.</em> 2018). The classification of
vegetation associations based on associations between floristic and
structural data is vital to inform biodiversity planning and management,
including natural resources management, environmental impact
assessments, and conservation and restoration projects. Furthermore,
vegetation classification is integral to Australian biodiversity laws
and regulations (Brocklehurst <em>et al.</em> 2007; Cleary <em>et
al.</em> 2015; Freeman <em>et al.</em> 2015; Gellie <em>et al.</em>
2018).</p>

    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction and background</h1>
<p>The Cover Module records quantitative, accurate and repeatable
measures of vegetation and substrate cover within the plot, using the
point-intercept method. Cover is defined as the percentage of vertical
projection of the vegetation or substrate present within the plot
(Bonham 2013). Vegetation cover is characterised by species, growth form
and the height of lower, mid and upper vegetation strata, while
substrate cover is characterised by substrate type (e.g. bare ground,
cryptogram, litter, rocks; Sparrow <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>
<p>Cover is interpreted from the number of ‘hits’ for each species and
growth form, plus substrate type, at 1 m intervals along 10 x 100 m
transects in a grid configuration (<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>), for a total
of 1010 point-intercepts. The transect layout includes five transects 20
m apart orientated north (N) to south (S) and five transects 20 m apart
orientated east (E) to west (W; <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>). Transect ends are at least
initially located and recorded with a GNSS device (see Plot Selection
and Layout Module) to ensure positional accuracy and that transects can
be located on future visits.</p>
<p>A graduated staff is used to measure the height of each hit of
vegetation at each point-intercept, enabling coarse height profiles to
be created (Muir <em>et al.</em> 2011). A downward-facing laser pointer
is mounted on the staff to mark each intercept. At sites with an
overstorey, canopy hits are determined at each point-intercept using a
GRS Densitometer™ (<a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>).</p>
<p>The Cover Module includes a Standard protocol in which the fractional
cover of photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation and
bare ground is collected along four 100 m transects in a grid
configuration (<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>), for a total of 404 point-intercepts. The
transect layout includes two transects 40 m apart orientated north to
south (N2/S2 and N4/S4) and two transects 40 m apart orientated east to
west (E2/W2 and E4/W4; <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<p>The Enhanced protocol collects species and growth form cover data
from 1010 point-intercepts, and is best practice and recommended,
particularly for studies that require reliable measures of cover per
species or growth form. The Standard protocol is intended for use where
survey time is limited and is suitable in studies where interpreting
fractional cover is sufficient.</p>
<p>Species, growth form, height and cover data collected in the Enhanced
protocol can be used to assign a vegetation classification consistent
with Level 5 (association) of the NVIS, which provides a simple,
consistent description of the vegetation and its structural complexity
(White <em>et al.</em> 2012). At Level 5, the dominant species, growth
form, height and cover (to a maximum of three species) are recorded for
each of the three main strata (Upper, Mid and Ground; NVIS Technical
Working Group 2017).</p>
