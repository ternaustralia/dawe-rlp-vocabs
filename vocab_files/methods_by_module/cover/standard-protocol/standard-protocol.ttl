    Cover recorded from 404 point-intercepts across the plot for all intercepts from the ground to the canopy, including substrate, species, growth form and height.
    This module serves as a sub-protocol of the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover</a> module. 
    Prior to implementing this protocol, it is essential to thoroughly review the Introduction, Key Definitions and Terminology,
    Rationale, and Module Overview provided in the "<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover</a>" module.
    These sections will provide you with important contextual information and a comprehensive understanding of the protocol.

<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics Module</a>– Species cover data are recorded using naming
consistent with the flora species identifications/assigned field names,
which must be recorded in the <em>Floristics</em> module prior to
undertaking the Cover Module.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-1">Time requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1 – 2 hours depending on the density and complexity of
vegetation.</p></li>
<li><p>If undertaking the Fire Severity Module concurrently, allow an
additional 30-60 minutes.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-1">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Point-intercept surveys are best conducted with two personnel,
one making the point-intercept<br/>
observations, and the other recording the data directly into the app and
assisting with tree height<br/>
measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor that conducted the Floristics Module should be
involved to ensure consistent nomenclature.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor making the observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying the<br/>
characteristic identifiable features of flora species and how to
distinguish one species from another. If surveyors are not confident,
time should be dedicated to practising, using field reference guides,
and seeking advice before conducting this protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Point-intercept surveys do not involve interference with
vegetation or wildlife. Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife
ethics approvals are unlikely to be required but always check with your
local authority. Access permissions are required.</p></li>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="efficiency">Efficiency</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Laying out a set of tape measures along multiple transects,
rather than one transect at a time, is more efficient. This is
particularly the case if the survey team comprises more generalist
surveyors and/or volunteers who can lay out the tapes while the
vegetation specialist commences the point-intercept transects.</p></li>
<li><p>Tape measures should ideally be labelled metrically on both sides
for ease of reading.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="rules-for-determining-what-is-a-hit">Rules
for determining what is a ‘hit’</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Where a part of a plant of the same species and growth form is
being intercepted at different heights, the uppermost intercept is
recorded as a hit and all lower intercepts are ignored. This includes
plants that are intercepted with the laser pointer, touching the staff
between the laser pointer and the densitometer, and/or intercepting the
vertical line of sight through the densitometer.</p></li>
<li><p>If part of a tree or shrub intersects the vertical line of sight
through the densitometer, this is recorded as a hit.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="enhanced-protocol-1">Enhanced protocol</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>If you intercept a dead plant and can determine what the species
is, this is recorded as a hit for that species but flagged as

<li><p>If you intercept a dead plant but you cannot determine what the
species is, this is recorded as an <em>annual forb</em>, <em>annual
grass</em> or <em>shrub/tree</em> (pre-recorded field names) and flagged
as <em>dead</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="estimating-tree-height">Estimating tree
height</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Tree height should ideally be estimated using a forestry
rangefinder for rapid and accurate height measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>When using a rangefinder, the distance and the angle to the top
of the tree are measured at the same time, and then the distance angle
to the base of the tree are measured at the same time. The internal
calculator will then calculate the height. Ensure you are far enough
from the tree, at least the distance of the height of the tree, and can
see the top and base of the tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Where a rangefinder is not available, tree height can be
estimated using the following methods:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Clinometer and tape</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile phone applications</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>When using a clinometer and tape, find a place to stand where you
can see the top of the tree. Your distance from the tree should at least
be equal to the height of the tree. Measure the distance between
yourself and the tree and measure the height from your eye to the
ground. Look through the clinometer with one eye and at the tree with
the other eye. Line up the crosshair in the clinometer with the top of
the tree. Read the value on the percent scale. This gives you the tree's
height as a percentage of the distance from the tree (e.g. a reading of
50% means the height of the tree is half the distance you are from the
tree).</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Calculate the height of the tree using the equation:</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tree height = clinometer reading / 100 x distance to tree +
eye height</em></p></li>
<li><p>On sloping ground, two readings will need to be taken: treetop
(reading 1) and tree base (reading 2). When the surveyor is standing
above the level of the tree base, the two percent values are added.
Calculate the height of the tree using the equation:</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tree height = (clinometer reading 1 + clinometer reading 2) /
100 x distance to tree</em></p></li>
<li><p>When the surveyor is standing below the level of the tree base,
the tree base percent is subtracted from the treetop percent. Calculate
the height of the tree using the following equation:</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tree height = (clinometer reading 1 - clinometer reading 2) /
100 x distance to tree</em></p></li>
<li><p>See <a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a> for diagrams of using a clinometer in each
situation.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>There are several mobile phone applications that provide an
estimate of tree height. Like the clinometer guidelines above, a
measurement of the distance to the tree is required to estimate the
height.</p></li>

<li><p>For each transect lay out a 100 m tape using pegs to secure it in

<li><p>Move to the 0 m mark of the first transect you wish to complete.
It does not matter which order, or which direction each transect is
completed, as your start position will be recorded in step 6.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the Cover Module and then <em>Standard protocol</em> in

<em>plot is burnt</em> check box and enter the ignition date. This will
reveal fire severity and resprouting fields for every intersect on the
four Standard protocol transects only (see the Fire Severity Module).
The <em>trunk char height</em> component will also appear below the
<em>point intercept</em> component in the Monitor app. Trunk char height
is recorded at the four locations where the four Standard protocol
transects intersect (see the Fire Severity Module).</p></li>
<li><p>Record your <em>starting point</em> (i.e. N2, N4, S2, S4, E2, E4,
W2 or W4). This records the <em>transect</em> you are on and the
<em>sampling direction</em> (e.g. ‘N2’ means you are starting at the
northern end of transect 2 and moving from north to south, while ‘S4’
means you are starting at the southern end of transect 4 and moving from
south to north).</p></li>
<li><p>Using a staff with laser pointer mounted on the pole at a height
of 1.5 m and GRS Densitometer™ mounted at the top of the pole (for plots
with an upper storey), place the bottom of the staff at the 0 m mark of
the tape measure. Ensure the staff is vertical and the laser pointer is
pointing downwards so the laser beam will intercept the ground near the
base of the staff.</p></li>
