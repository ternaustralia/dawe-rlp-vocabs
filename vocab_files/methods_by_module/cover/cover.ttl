</li>
<li>Move to the 0 m mark of the first transect you wish to complete. It does not matter which order, or which direction each transect is completed, as your start position will be recorded in step 5.</li>
<li>Select the &lsquo;Cover&rsquo; module and then &lsquo;Full protocol&rsquo; in the App (Figure 6).<img src="https://w3id.org/tern/static/dawe-rlp/latest/cover/cover-module-app-screen.png" alt="Figure 6.

<li>Record your starting point (i.e. N1&ndash;5, S1&ndash;5, E1&ndash;5, or W1&ndash;5). This records the transect you are on and the direction you are travelling in (e.g. &lsquo;N1&rsquo; means you are travelling south on the the N1/S1 transect, while &lsquo;S2&rsquo; means you are travelling north on the N2/S2 transect, etc.).</li>
<li>Place the bottom of the staff at the 0 m mark of the tape measure. Ensure the staff is vertical and the laser pointer is pointing downwards so the laser beam will intercept the ground near the base of the staff (Figure 7).<img src="https://w3id.org/tern/static/dawe-rlp/latest/cover/surveyor.png" alt="Figure 7. Surveyor at the 0 m mark of a transect with the graduated, adjustable staff verticle and laser pointing downwards. " width="233" height="286" /></li>
<li>For each point-intercept, you will begin by recording the nature of the substrate which is intercepted by the laser beam. Press the button on the laser pointer. If the laser beam is intercepted by vegetation, move the vegetation aside so that the laser beam reaches the substrate.</li>
<li>For each point-intercept, assess and record the substrate from the categories available (defined in Appendix B. Substrate types and their definitions).:
<ul>
<li>Bare.</li>
<li>Crypto (cryptogam, i.e. any lichen, moss, algae, crust, etc. present on the soil surface).</li>
<li>Litter (dried vegetation not attached and not identifiable; if litter is attached and identifiable as a plant, it should be recorded as this species but flagged as being dried).</li>
<li>CWD (coarse woody debris detached from source and greater than 10 cm diameter at point of intercept; woody debris less than 10 cm at point of intercept should be recorded as &lsquo;Litter&rsquo;).</li>
<li>Gravel (between 2 mm and 2 cm).</li>
<li>Rock (greater than 2 cm).</li>
<li>Outcrop.</li>
<li>Water.</li>
<li>Ash.</li>
<li>Unknown.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where the laser beam intersects with a vascular plant, the plant&rsquo;s uppermost height at the point of intersection is recorded along with species name and growth form. Measurements can be rounded to the nearest centimetre from the markings on the staff. Continue recording all other plant species (and height) that are intersected by the beam to a height of 1.5 m (see guidelines).</li>
<li>Record all plants (species and uppermost height) that the staff touches between the laser pointer (1.5 m) and the densitometer (eye level).</li>
<li>The GRS Densitometer&trade; is used to view canopy intercepts that are taller than the densitometer. Look through the densitometer to determine whether any portion of a tree/shrub crown intersects the vertical line of sight through the densitometer. The vertical line of sight is obtained by levelling both of the densitometer bubble-levels and then looking through the instrument so that the sighting marks (cross hairs and circle) are aligned.</li>
<li>If foliage or branches of a live shrub/tree are sighted in the cross hairs, record each species name and estimate the height at the uppermost intercept using a rangefinder or other height estimation method (see guidelines).</li>
<li>If no part of the foliage or branches are sighted in the cross hairs but the vertical line is still within the canopy boundary, record as &lsquo;In Canopy Sky&rsquo; (ICS; see Figure 4 for further information).</li>
<li>Repeat steps 6 to 13 at every 1 m interval along the transect. This will give a total of 101 point-intercepts for transect.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 to 14 for each of the remaining point-intercept transect lines until all 10 have been completed. This will give 1010 point-intercepts for the plot.</li>
<li>At the completion of the point-intercept data collection, select &lsquo;Finish Point-intercept&rsquo;.</li>

Like the clinometer guidelines above, a measurement of the distance to the tree is required to estimate the height. Some apps allow the user to enter a measurement made with a tape, while others allow the user to enter and store the distance of their stride, and then enter the number of strides into the app to calculate the distance to the tree. Certain apps (e.g. Arboreal &ndash; Tree Height) make use of the device&rsquo;s augmented reality technology to measure this distance, whereby the user moves close to the trunk of a tree (within 1 m), moves the device to locate the tree, aims at the tree and presses mark, holds the device upright while walking away from the tree to about the same length as the tree height, and presses mark again to calculate the distance.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:60,&quot;335559740&quot;:288}">&nbsp;</span></li>
