    dcterms:description """<p>
  The LepiLED light trap with funnel attachment is set from before dusk, at a
  selected location within the plot, and collected the next morning. The
  operation time can vary between 2 and 10 hours. The location is selected to
  maximise the potential catch. One trap is used per plot, for one night. The
  timing of light-trapping within a monitoring event is selected based on the
  weather conditions. Light trapping is most effective at warm times of the year
  when insects are most active (Bamford et al. 2013).
</p>
<p>
  The repeat interval for monitoring is project dependent (e.g., annual,
  seasonal). For repeat monitoring, trap at the same time of year and moon
  phase, in the same location, for the same number of hours starting from the
  same time before dusk, and during similar weather conditions (Patrick 2016).

  <li>
    <p>
      Prior to the monitoring event, check the weather forecast and assess the
      suitability to undertake light trapping. If unsuitable/unpredictable,
      consider an alternative time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Prior to dusk (while it is still light), carry the Mobile device, Trimble®
      R1 and light trap to the fauna plot, avoiding walking through the
      vegetation plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure the weather logger has been installed and running (refer to
      Vertebrate fauna module).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select a trap site within the fauna plot – this can be anywhere that is
      open, where wind effects are minimised, and away from other external light
      sources.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Set up the LepiLED light trap with funnel trap (<u>do not</u> turn on the
      light at this point). The trap can be suspended from a tree branch,
      ensuring the bottom of the funnel attachment is above the ground and clear
      of any vegetation which might damage it. Insects are generally wet
      sampled, using a collection bottle attachment filled with 95% ethanol or
      undiluted propylene glycol. Alternatively, if dry specimens are required,
      the trap can be lined with pest strips to kill the insects, or they can be
      caught live, then killed using a kill jar and extracted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Using permanent marker, label the outside of the vial temporarily with the
      Plot ID, Trap ID and date. If dry sampling, screw up some egg
      cartons/newspaper and add to the funnel attachment to prevent insects from
      damage in the trap.

      Remove trap. Select the correct Plot ID and Trap ID. The date/time of the
      trap removal will be auto-recorded. The duration of trapping will be
      auto-calculated based on the start date/time and trap removal date/time.
      Check these are correct and overide if necessary. Press Save. Remove the

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Top up the sample containers with preserving fluid (undiluted propylene
      glycol or 95% ethanol) if necessary, to prevent fluid splashing around and
      damaging the samples in the container. Return the lid and ensure it is
      screwed on tightly. For additional measure, place a small sticker barcode
      (duplicate of the code in the sample) on the side of the sample container
      – this enables the sample information to be readily retrieved without
      having to open the container and remove the label from the fluid for
      scanning.

      Repeat from Step 26 if collecting different samples (e.g. some dry, some
      wet) from the same trap. Each individually stored sample is given a unique
      barcode.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Store the containers in a cool location out of direct light. Do not leave
      in hot vehicle or in sun as this degrades the sample for DNA analysis.

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Moths discolour and lose scales if wet killed/preserved, hence this method
      is generally opposed by entomologists. Wet sampling is the adopted
      approach however as it is most time efficient and the samples are suitable
      for DNA analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If opting to dry sample, scrunched newspaper/egg cartons should be added
      to the trap attachment, so the trapped insects have shelter and don’t get
      damaged. Live capture takes a lot more time in the field and should only
      be undertaken when dry specimens are required.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Light trapping should be avoided:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>in windy or excessively wet conditions</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>on clear, cold nights</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>during a full moon</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>if there are other obvious sources of bright light, and</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          close to rivers and surface water because of the large number of
          freshwater insects that may be encountered that will interfere with
          the trapping of other groups.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To be effective, the light from the light trap must be brighter than the
      surrounding nightscape. Choose a site where the background is as dark as
      possible (Patrick 2016). Light sensor apps are available which can be used
      to note the lumens/m<sup>2</sup> of light pollution at the trap location
      (Montgomery et al. 2021).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If taxa are being targeted, placement of the light trap in the plot should
      aim to maximise the catch of the target taxa. Locate the trap as close as
      practical to the target insect community or host plants, so more target
      insects are exposed to the light. The trap should ideally be located where
      it is sheltered from the wind.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is difficult to know what area light traps collect from and if
      additional traps are set up, it is important to ensure that they are set
      up some distance away so that they collect independently.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the trap conditions or results are undesirable, the trap can be reset
      within the plot on another night (all sampling events must be recorded,
      and the catch preserved as the results of any successive trapping events
      may be impacted by previous trapping).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      LED performance can decrease with the age of the LED, accelerated by high
      temperatures and high currents. For this reason, LEDs in the lamp are not
      being operated at the maximum possible current (700 mA) but only at 350
      mA, aided by an efficient cooling system. Ageing of the acrylic glass and
      other materials could possibly also influence the radiation flux (Brehm
      2017). For this reason, it is recommended that trap components are tested
      (e.g., every 5 years) and replaced if necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Safety</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Care must be taken when using the LepiLED as they emit ultraviolet
      radiation which is harmful to the eyes. Avoid looking directly at the lamp
      when it is operating. Use of UV-blocking face shields and goggles is
      recommended. Maintain a distance of at least 50 cm away from the light and
      ensure other people in the area are aware of the safety requirements.
