   <h1 id="module-overview">Module Overview</h1>
<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols</h2>
<p>The Invertebrate Fauna Module offers five standardised field sampling
protocols for terrestrial invertebrates: active search, wet-pitfall
trapping, rapid ground trapping, malaise trapping, and pan trapping. The
field sampling protocols are summarised below and in <a href="#table-1">Table 1</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/e76e99ef-de1d-4387-9b2e-3455b9f9ff78">Active search</a></strong> involves a diurnal and nocturnal
meander across the plot for 60 minutes (minimum for a single observer),
recording observations and collecting representative specimens of as
many different invertebrate taxa as possible within the set time.
Diurnal active search includes looking in and around habitat features
such as under logs, rocks, litter and bark, on leaves and flowers, as
well as using hand-held sampling apparatus such as sweep nets, beat
sticks, and aspirators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/7e4bfab2-4056-4309-bd22-f070f6952bc0">Wet pitfall trapping</a></strong> consists of a grid of 20
traps (specimen containers), dug into the ground so they are flush with
the soil surface, and partially filled with a liquid preservative to
rapidly kill invertebrates that fall in. The trap grid is established
anywhere within the plot, consisting of 4 north-south rows of 5 traps,
spaced 10 m apart. Wet pitfall trapping is the most common and efficient
passive survey method for surface dwelling terrestrial (epigeic)
arthropods, in particular ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), spiders
(Araenae) and ground beetles (Coleoptera, especially Carabidae and
Staphylinidae).</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/e9a8e65a-59d3-49f0-831d-094c568c5284">Rapid ground trapping</a></strong> consists of small plastic
vials with a protein and sugar bait, placed directly onto the ground, in
a grid of 4 north-south rows of 5 traps, spaced 10 m apart within a row
and 20 m between rows. This achieves good coverage of the plot to
maximise the ant diversity sampled. Traps are retrieved after 30–60
minutes, before the bait is depleted. Rapid ground trapping is focused
on dominant ant species (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and is a suitable
option when field time is limited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/666e5aa5-e545-4637-bc52-a296d647b303">Pan trapping</a></strong> consists of small, coloured bowls
placed on the ground, either filled with water and a small amount of
dishwashing liquid for sampling over one day, or propylene glycol for
sampling over a longer duration. Pan traps are set in 2 fixed transects
of 12 traps, spaced 5 m apart, 10 m in from either side of the plot. Pan
trapping is most effective at sampling flies (Diptera), bees and wasps
(Hymenoptera), as well as aphids (Hemiptera), thrips (Thysanoptera),
some beetles (Coleoptera) and grasshoppers (Orthoptera).</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/4a2c4309-da43-4ad4-b1eb-637d2e70580d">Malaise trapping</a></strong> consists of a tent-like trap
(Townes style) that intercepts insects in flight. A single malaise trap
is positioned at a chosen location within the plot, aimed at maximising
potential captures. Malaise trapping is the most effective method for
flies (Diptera) and wasps (Hymenoptera) but also captures true bugs,
bees, moths, butterflies and dragonflies, as well as ground-dwelling
species that climb up the trap or emerge from the ground below.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The field sampling protocols can be undertaken within the fauna plot.
The field sampling protocols are straightforward and do not require
specific expertise. The focus is the collection of bulk mixed
invertebrate samples from each trap/location, which are typically wet
preserved for future taxonomic and DNA analysis. This module includes a
post-field curation protocol relevant to all invertebrate samples,
detailing preservation, storage, labelling, sorting and data capture
requirements (<a href="#table-1">Table 1</a>).</p>

Module (e.g. the detection of new, threatened, poorly known or pest
invertebrate species) may trigger the need for targeted surveys. Where
the research goals of individual projects dictate variation in survey

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Active sampling</td>
<td>Direct collection of specimens by the collector (e.g. hand
collecting, foliage beating, sweep netting).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Arthropod</td>
<td>Invertebrates with jointed legs. They are divided into four major
groups: insects; myriapods (including centipedes and millipedes);
arachnids (including spiders, mites and scorpions); and crustaceans
(including slaters).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bio-indicator</td>
<td>A species or group of species that readily reflects the abiotic or
biotic state of an environment; represents the impact of environmental
change on a habitat, community, or ecosystem; or is indicative of the
diversity of a subset of taxa, or the wholesale diversity, within an
area (McGeoch 1998).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Detritivore</td>
<td>Invertebrates that decompose dead organic matter or facilitate
microbial decomposition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DNA barcoding</td>
<td>A method that utilizes sequence variation in a standardized gene
fragment to rapidly sort and objectively differentiate species (Centre
of Biodiversity Genomics 2021).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eDNA</td>
<td>Environmental DNA is biological material, such as shed cells,
excrement, exuvia and reproductive secretions among other sources, that
is continuously released into the environment by all living
macro-organisms (Valentin et al. 2020). eDNA can be collected within
samples of soil, sediment, water or faeces. Advances in sequencing or
metabarcoding techniques allow the reliable reading of DNA sources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Epigeic</td>
<td>An organism that crawls on the soil surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fauna plot</td>
<td>Where the standardised survey of vertebrate fauna is undertaken
(generally 100 m x 100 m; 1 ha). The fauna plot should be in an area
where the vegetation, relief and soil are homogenous and consistent with
that of the adjacent core monitoring plot. The Invertebrate Fauna Module
is undertaken within the fauna plot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Indicator species</td>
<td>An organism whose presence, absence or abundance reflects a specific
environmental condition. Indicator species can signal a change in the
biological condition of a particular ecosystem and thus may be used as a
proxy to diagnose the health of an ecosystem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Invertebrate</td>
<td>An animal that lacks a backbone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kill jar</td>
<td>A lidded glass container that comprises a small amount of ethyl
acetate to euthanise samples.</td>

<tr>
<td>Malaise trap</td>
<td>Large tent-like structure made of netting designed to funnel flying
insects to a common area and into a collection vial (Malaise, 1937)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Metagenomics</td>
<td>The study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental
samples. Soil metagenomics provides the opportunity to understand what
organisms are present in survey plots and provides an indication of
their abundance (White <em>et al.</em> 2012).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mesofauna</td>
<td>Very small invertebrates between 0.1mm and 2mm in size, which live
in the soil or leaf litter layer on the soil surface.</td>

<td>Microfauna</td>
<td>Tiny invertebrates &lt;0.1 mm in size, which live in the soil or
leaf litter layer on the soil surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Monitor</td>
<td>Field data collection app for Ecological Monitoring System
Australia. Collects data using the Biodiversity Information Standard for
delivery to the Australian Biodiversity Data Repository managed by the
Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Morphospecies</td>
<td>A group of biological organisms whose members differ from all other
groups in some aspect of their form and structure but are so similar
among themselves that they are lumped together for analysis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Passive sampling</td>
<td>Sampling devices are left in the field to collect material without
the collector present (e.g. traps to intercept or attract
invertebrates).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RTU</td>
<td>Recognisable taxonomic unit (e.g. morphospecies).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SRE</td>
<td>Short-range endemic. These are species with naturally small
distributions, that typically exhibit poor dispersal powers, confinement
to discontinuous or rare habitats, slow growth and low fecundity. By
their very nature, they are most likely to be threatened by habitat

methods included in this Module. Note that rapid ground trapping is not
included in Montgomery et al. (2021) and the size of the wet pitfall

<p><span class="anchor" id="appendix-3"></span><h4>Appendix 3. Measurement goals of invertebrate fauna benchmarking and monitoring studies.</h4></p>
<p>Source: Montgomery et al. (2021)</p>
<p><strong>Occurrence and distribution</strong>: Changes in occurrence
and distribution are important indicators of how shifts in underlying
processes affect organisms. Occurrence can also sometimes serve as
proxies for abundance (Royle and Nichols 2003). Estimating occurrence
and distribution requires, at minimum, the formal identification of a
taxon at a location (i.e., a presence), but the addition of data on what
taxa were not present (i.e., an absence), allows for a more powerful
analysis of occurrence. For insects, occurrence and distribution
monitoring is perhaps the most widespread benchmarking method (e.g.,
Chen et al. 2009; Boyes et al. 2019; Outhwaite et al. 2019), especially
for invasive species and in the context of shifting ranges due to
climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Phenology</strong>: Shifts in phenology can indicate changes
in the factors governing the timing of insect life cycles, from
temperature and precipitation patterns, to flowering periods in plants.
Shifts in insect phenology can cause mismatches with other taxa in their
communities, from plants to birds, and can have demographic consequences
for those taxa (Visser and Gienapp 2019). Estimating phenology typically
requires, at minimum, presence data for a taxon at a location repeatedly
over a short time span (i.e., a “season”), but presence and absence data
together allow for stronger inference. Changes in insect phenology are
poorly documented in most taxa, but recent interest in the effects of
climate change has spurred a larger focus on insect phenology in
monitoring efforts (Gimesi 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Abundance and biomass</strong>: Changes in abundance and
biomass, both measures of ecosystem function, are important for
understanding the health of the ecosystem as well as for conservation
and management. Estimating abundance and biomass typically requires
presence and absence data in addition to accurate counts of individuals
of each taxa. This form of monitoring is historically rare but has been
perhaps the most influential in spurring recent interest in insect
declines (Hallmann et al. 2017; Wepprich et al. 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Diversity and species composition</strong>: Changes in
measures of biodiversity, such as species diversity and composition,
indicate how communities respond to environmental change. Estimating
diversity and species composition typically requires presence and
absence data for multiple taxa in a community, with some expectation
that sampling is equally likely across taxa. Monitoring insect diversity
and composition is relatively common compared to abundance, biomass, and
phenological monitoring (e.g., Brooks et al. 2012; Valtonen et al.
2017).</p>

  <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Invertebrates constitute the majority of species richness, abundance
and biomass within terrestrial ecosystems (Oraby 2013; Barnett and Facey
2016; Evans 2016a; Williams 2020). An estimated 275,000 to 300,000
species of terrestrial invertebrate occur in Australia, including a
large proportion of endemic and undescribed species (Australian Museum
2021). They encompass a range of functional groups including herbivores,
pollinators, predators, parasitoids and detritivores, as well as
providing an important food source for other animals. They play critical
roles in ecosystem services and are involved in complex interactions
across multiple trophic levels (Lavelle et al. 2006; Prather et al.
2013; Kwok et al. 2016; Scudder 2017). However, few invertebrate groups
have been studied in detail and the ecology of most invertebrates,
particularly of their immature stages, remains poorly known (Williams
2020).</p>
<p>The lack of clear survey guidelines has been an impediment to the
broadscale implementation of terrestrial invertebrate surveys to date
(Ward and Larivière 2004; Majer and Framenau 2017; Montgomery <em>et
al.</em> 2021). Published studies highlight many variations exist in
sampling protocols (e.g. trap design and sampling technique,
configuration and intensity, preservatives used), and this limits the
ability to compare results across studies. In addition, sampling
protocols are often poorly reported, which limits the ability to re-use
methods (Majer and Framenau 2017; Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021), and
few studies include the necessary number of replicates and repeated
sampling to monitor long-term change (Montgomery <em>et al.</em>
2021).</p>
<p>Invertebrates are considered good indicators of environmental change
due to their abundance, diversity, ease of collection, ecological
importance, fast growth rates and population turnover, environmental
sensitivity and rapid responses to change (Pik <em>et al.</em> 2002;
Ward and Larivière 2004; Oraby 2013; Andersen <em>et al.</em> 2022).
Monitoring that incorporates a range of functional invertebrate groups
can identify patterns in composition, diversity and environmental
condition, at more meaningful scales than can be measured using plants
and vertebrate fauna (Pik <em>et al.</em> 2002; Andersen <em>et al.</em>
2004; Ward and Larivière 2004).</p>
<h3 id="which-taxa-to-target">Which taxa to target</h3>
<p>It is common practice to select focal invertebrate taxa as
bio-indicators and surrogates for total biodiversity. There are no set
criteria for selecting which taxa to target, however factors to consider
include the:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>aims of the project and the specific purpose of
monitoring</p></li>
<li><p>influences that are thought to be acting and predicted taxa
response</p></li>
<li><p>sensitivity of the taxa to environmental change</p></li>
<li><p>biological reliability of the taxa (i.e. how well they represent
other taxa)</p></li>
<li><p>practicality of sampling (i.e. abundant, diverse, taxonomically
manageable, readily sampled)(McGeoch 1998; Andersen and Majer 2004;
Hodkinson and Jackson 2005; Oberprieler <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The invertebrate groups commonly selected for terrestrial ecosystem
monitoring include ants, ground beetles, sucking bugs, spiders and land
snails, and to a lesser extent butterflies (Andersen and Majer 2004;
Stanisic <em>et al.</em> 2005). Other invertebrate groups may be equally
useful for monitoring but are less well studied.</p>
<h3 id="which-sampling-methods">Which sampling methods</h3>
<p>There is no one-method-fits-all approach to sampling given the vast
number of invertebrate species and their different physical, biological
and ecological characteristics (Oliver and Beattie 1996). Many sampling
methods and variations of those methods exist, each with inherent biases
(Sherley and Stringer 2016). Choosing which sampling method/s to use
will depend on the project aims and the target taxa, and should consider
consistency, reliability, and precision (Spafford and Lortie 2013).</p>
<p>A review of invertebrate sampling methods was undertaken to inform
the selection of the five protocols (four passive and one active)
included in this module. The protocols were chosen because of their
efficacy across a range of terrestrial habitats, focus on taxa commonly
selected for ecosystem monitoring, simple methods that can be undertaken
by non-specialists, use of non-specialised equipment that is inexpensive
and readily available, and acceptance and use by the entomological
research community, enabling comparisons with existing datasets. Where
applicable, they follow existing, established protocols.</p>
<p>In general, active sampling is useful for creating a species
inventory and enables associations to be identified between
invertebrates and host plants/habitat components. Passive sampling can
be standardised more easily and captures a range of invertebrates with
minimal effort (Queensland Museum 2005; Bulbert <em>et al.</em> 2007;
Sherley and Evans 2016). The diversity, abundance and biomass of samples
can be measured (post-field), to help identify trends overtime, and
examine the influence of environmental factors such as weather, habitat
and land use (Hallmann et al. 2017). Undertaking a range of protocols is
recommended (even for small project areas) as this maximises estimates
of species richness and abundance and ultimately increases the ability
to detect changes in response to disturbances and treatments (Cane
<em>et al.</em> 2000; King and Porter 2005; Spafford and Lortie 2013;
Berglund and Milberg 2019; Basset <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>
<p>All protocols involve destructive sampling, deemed appropriate at
this point in time for definitive taxonomic identification, detecting
cryptic species, biogeography, future proofing, developing reference
libraries and for potential research (Upton <em>et al.</em> 2010;
Hoekman <em>et al.</em> 2017). Destructive methods can be problematic
for long-term studies because they can reduce the overall abundance of
invertebrates in the local area (Sherley and Stringer 2016; Montgomery
<em>et al.</em> 2021), impacting on repeat survey results. The effects
of destructive sampling are in part mitigated by the spatial separation
between monitoring plots, the restricted number of traps/sampling
locations per plot and temporal restrictions in sampling.</p>
<p>If a project has an existing invertebrate monitoring program, then
continued use of those methods is justified in that context; in such
cases the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/420ce0a7-9364-4bf4-861c-ef5f710e31b9">Targeted Survey Module</a> can be used to record the data.</p>
<p>Terrestrial invertebrate communities that are dependent on or
restricted to specific vegetation or habitat types (e.g. SREs) are
likely to be most impacted by ecosystem change (Houghton et al. 2019).
Ecotones (i.e. where ecosystems converge) and riparian zones are
productive areas for collecting invertebrates (Upton et al. 2010), but
are not covered by the plot based approach. For these reasons, targeted
invertebrate surveys (using the Targeted Survey Module) may be important
to supplement plot-based methods.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="active-search">Active search</h4>
<p>Active searching is complementary to the other protocols, as it can
reveal invertebrate taxa that may not be sampled by trapping methods.
The results may also trigger the need to undertake other survey
protocols and/or targeted surveys. Indirect invertebrate observations
via sign (e.g. ant nests, webs, cocoons, casings, shells, borings,
galls, burrows) can also be recorded. Observed invertebrates are
collected by hand, often assisted by hand-held apparatus (e.g. vial,
kill jar, aspirator, paint brush, forceps, collecting net, beating
tray). A representation of the different invertebrate
species/life-stages observed are photographed, collected, and preserved
for later identification and potential future analysis.</p>
<p>Active searching provides the opportunity to explore the range of
habitats and micro-habitats present within a plot, revealing
invertebrates from numerous taxa and functional groups, including
cryptic, conservation significant and short-range endemic taxa. Diurnal
and nocturnal searches are undertaken because they often produce very
different results in terms of the species sampled (Bulbert et al.
2007).</p>
<p>Soil and litter searches may reveal invertebrates of interest
additional to those found in wet pitfall traps, such as land snails,
mygalomorph spiders and burrows, millipedes, centipedes and scorpions
(Bamford et al. 2013). The use of hand-held sampling apparatus (e.g.
rake, net, beat stick, aspirator) is likely to increase the diversity of
taxa sampled. Active searching represents the best opportunity to detect
larger and more active invertebrates, especially at night (Southwood and
Henderson 2000).</p>
<p>Undertaking active search over a set time and area help to
standardise the method, however the data has limited use for ecosystem
monitoring because collection effort varies across the plot and among
different collectors, and the ease of collection is habitat dependent
(Bulbert et al. 2007). Because active search is primarily used for
inventory purposes, there is no need to remove large quantities of
invertebrates from the population (and sort through large samples) when
the data is not useful for site comparisons. If undertaking trapping
protocols, it is also likely that there will be duplicates in
sampling.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="wet-pitfall-trapping">Wet Pitfall Trapping</h4>
<p>The wet pitfall trapping protocol is based on the TERN Ant Monitoring
Protocol (Karan 2014). The trap size (4.5 cm diameter by 5.5 cm depth)
has been used extensively to monitor ants across Australia (Andersen and
Majer 2004), and represents a compromise between suitability for
invertebrate fauna monitoring (Higgins and Lindgren 2012; Hohbein and
Conway 2018) and minimising the risk to vertebrate fauna (Bulbert et al.
2007; Pendola and New 2007; National Health and Medical Research Council
2013; Brown and Matthews 2016; LeVan 2019; Jackson 2020).</p>
<p>The wet pitfall trapping protocol is suitable across most terrestrial
ecosystems where the substrate can be dug to 6 cm. The protocol adopts a
well-established grid approach (Andersen <em>et al.</em> 2022) with a 10
m inter-trap distance, which is the most common and recommended spacing
for wet pitfall trapping (Hohbein and Conway 2018). The wet pitfall
traps are set over multiple days, with the protocol designed to be
co-timed with other surveys.</p>
<p>Wet pitfall trapping captures a range of surface-active invertebrate
taxa, providing an opportunity to monitor functionally different groups.
It is a popular survey method to monitor bio-indicator species (Andersen
and Majer 2004; Oraby 2013). In Australia, ants are commonly selected as
indicators of habitat disturbance and ecological change because they are
ecologically dominant, readily sampled, have a wide distribution, and
are typically the most diverse and abundant taxa group recorded by wet
pitfall traps (Andersen and Majer 2004; Hoffmann 2010; Karan 2014; Lawes
<em>et al.</em> 2017; Sheikh <em>et al.</em> 2018). Ants occupy all
trophic levels, act as ecosystem engineers, feature in many mutualistic
interactions with plants, and are a key food resource for many
vertebrates. They are also Australia's best studied insect group in
terms of biogeography and community dynamics (Karan 2014; Andersen
<em>et al.</em> 2022). Other invertebrates (e.g. springtails, flies,
millipedes) will also be collected by wet pitfall traps, however it is
not the most efficient method for their collection (Brown and Matthews
2016; Sherley and Stringer 2016).</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="rapid-ground-trapping">Rapid Ground Trapping</h4>
<p>Rapid ground trapping is focused on dominant ant species. The value
of the method is when undertaken across multiple projects and sites, to
provide an overall picture of the distribution and abundance of dominant
ant species and to detect change over time. The use of an attractant
bait enables the capture of many specimens in a short period of time,
making this a suitable protocol to undertake when there is insufficient
time to undertake other ground invertebrate survey methods. The quick
retrieval of the traps limits the number of ant species captured to
simplify sample processing (Alan Andersen, personal communication, 2
June 2023). Trapping bias must be considered when reporting the
results.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="pan-trapping">Pan Trapping</h4>
<p>Pan trapping is most commonly used for monitoring bees and other
pollinators, and is generally a more effective method for trapping bees
than Malaise traps (Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021). Data on
pollinators is important to establish baselines, track population
change, identify the consequences of pollinator population declines,
determine functionally important species and guide conservation and
restoration programs (Popic et al. 2013). Rapid trapping (over 24 hours)
is useful for inventory and monitoring, however trapping over a longer
duration will provide more comprehensive results, given the flight
period varies for different pollinators, and may shift from year to year
(Droege et al. 2016).</p>
<p>The number of traps per plot is considered adequate for estimating
species richness of bees (Shapiro et al. 2014). Pan traps are mostly
commonly placed 5 m apart and this distance is considered sufficient to
decrease bee competition among traps (Droege et al. 2016). The exact
position of the traps is not important given the attractant nature of
the method.</p>
<p>Pan trapping is complementary with active search (including sweep
netting of flowering plants), as the composition of catches can be very
different (Cane et al. 2000; Berglund and Milberg 2019). Pan trapping is
also useful for sampling bees and elusive taxa when there are no flowers
present (e.g. after a fire) or in a ploughed paddock in an agricultural
setting (Cane et al. 2000).</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="malaise-trapping">Malaise Trapping</h4>
<p>The Townes’ style malaise trap is the most common trap design
(Montgomery et al. 2021) and is the adopted approach of the Global
Malaise Program (GMP). Hence it was selected for this protocol, to
ensure uniformity in design (i.e. trap size, mesh size, colour and
shape), to support comparisons within and between sites in Australia and
at a global scale (Skvarla et al. 2020; D'Souza et al. 2021; Montgomery
et al. 2021).</p>
<p>Malaise traps are simple and easily operated, require the least
collection effort of all the invertebrate sampling methods, and can
result in diverse and abundant captures. The standard protocol is to set
a single malaise trap per plot, as this will likely yield catch results
sufficient for most purposes. The protocol is consistent with the
requirements of the GMP.</p>
<p>Comparisons with other sampling methods have shown that malaise traps
reveal a significant proportion of the local arthropod fauna (Evans
2016b; Whitman <em>et al.</em> 2019; Centre of Biodiversity Genomics
2021). Once a trap is in place, it can be left unattended for up to
seven days before the collection bottle needs changing (GMP 2019;
D'Souza <em>et al.</em> 2021). The collection bottle can be swapped or
emptied without having to dismantle the trap (Whitman <em>et al.</em>
2019). The collection bottles are not impacted by rainfall like some
other sampling methods, which means malaise trapping is also suitable in
areas with heavy rainfall (Skvarla <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>
<p>The biomass of samples provides a measure of flying insect
productivity and index of energy availability for higher trophic levels,
which can be used to identify trends over time and examine the influence
of environmental factors (Hallmann et al. 2017). The samples are wet
weighed to preserve them for future identification and DNA analysis
(Welti et al. 2022).</p>
<p>Malaise traps and wet pitfall traps are complementary techniques as
both collect highly diverse arthropod assemblages but have little
overlap in the species they sample (Skvarla et al. 2020).</p>

<li><p>Plan how invertebrate samples will be preserved, stored, sorted

discuss:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Specific collection, preservation and storage
requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>The availability and cost of taxonomic identification and genetic

<li><p>Options for long-term storage.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Determine when sampling will be conducted, where sampling will be
conducted (scale) and how often it will be repeated (see Montgomery
<em>et al.</em> (2021)). Peak periods for invertebrate sampling (i.e.
when activity is highest) is typically September to April in eastern
Australia, following the wet season in northern Australia, in the cooler
months in southern and south-western Australia, and in the weeks
following good rainfall in arid areas of central Australia. Other times
of year are still useful for monitoring and may reveal different species
and life-stages, including some less common species (Upton <em>et
al.</em> 2010). In areas with unpredictable rainfall, standardising the
sampling time in relation to a recent rainfall event may be more
important than standardising the month of sampling (Callan et al. 2011).
Given invertebrates can respond to change quicker than plants and
animals, and their presence and movements are strongly linked to
phenological events, intra-annual sampling covering a range of temporal
and meteorological conditions can provide more comprehensive results
(Battelle 2020; Grange <em>et al.</em> 2021). The time of day can be
important e.g. early mornings can be productive as insects begin
actively feeding. Insect activity typically declines in hot weather
(Upton <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p></li>
<li><p>It is helpful to be familiar with the common invertebrate orders
before conducting surveys, although visual identification of
invertebrates in the field is not required as all captures are collected
for later identification. There are a number of useful invertebrate
identification web resources available, prepared by <a href="http://anic.ento.csiro.au/insectfamilies/">CSIRO</a>, <a href="https://australian.museum/learn/teachers/learning/bugwise/">Australian Museum</a> and Insect Investigators</a>. A list of useful books and identification keys is
also provided in Upton et al. (2010).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="permits">Permits</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Surveys must be undertaken in accordance with permits and
licensing. Most invertebrate surveys do not require specific permits,
but always check with the local authority. Requirements vary depending
on the location and the presence of threatened and restricted species.
Permits are required to collect terrestrial invertebrates listed at a
state or Commonwealth level. A scientific permit is required if
undertaking work in a protected area. Special permit requirements may
apply for offshore islands (e.g. Lord Howe Island, Christmas Island and
Macquarie Island) because of their natural heritage value. Wildlife
ethics approval is required if there is a risk to vertebrate
fauna.</p></li>

  <h1 id="introduction-and-background">Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>Terrestrial invertebrate fauna are diverse and prolific and have
adapted to occupy nearly every ecological niche (Australian Museum

<ul>
<li><p>Insects: ants, aphids, bees, beetles, bristletails, bugs,
butterflies, cicadas, cockroaches, crickets, fleas, flies, earwigs,
grasshoppers, lacewings, leafhoppers, lerps, lice, locusts, mantids,

</ul>
<p>The field sampling protocols in this module are not intended to cover
the full range of terrestrial invertebrates present. The active search
protocol is typically undertaken at the start of a project to obtain a
baseline inventory of the invertebrate fauna taxa observed within a
plot. The four passive sampling protocols are aimed at specific
invertebrate groups (<a href="#table-1">Table 1</a>) and provide a benchmark of the diversity
and composition of species present, informing the selection of key taxa
and survey methods for ongoing monitoring. The suitability of the
protocols for sampling commonly monitored invertebrate groups is
summarised in <a href="appendix-2">Appendix 2</a>. Repeat sampling aims to monitor long-term
trends, measure change in insect populations and communities over time,
and better understand the relationships underlying ecosystem function
and maintenance. Monitoring typically aims to measure change in:
occurrence and distribution, phenology, abundance and biomass, or
diversity and species composition. The spatiotemporal scale of sampling
depends on the focus of monitoring (Montgomery <em>et al.</em> (2021);
<a href="appendix-3">Appendix 3</a>).</p>
<p>Environmental factors such as weather strongly influence invertebrate
activity and trap efficiency, and the response to these factors varies
between taxa. Consistency in trapping location and timing is key to
obtaining comparable trapping results, and repeat sampling should be
undertaken at the same time of year, moon phase and during similar
weather and environmental conditions (Brown and Matthews 2016; Evans
2016b; Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021).</p>
<p>Accurately and consistently recording survey metadata is important
for repeatability and determining environmental relationships
(Montgomery et al. 2021). The standardised sampling design enables the
comparison of species richness, composition and abundance within and
between plots and over time. The collection of plot-based vegetation
data enables analysis of trap results in relation to resource
availability.</p>
<p>The post-field sample curation protocol is relevant to all
invertebrate sampling. Invertebrate samples are retained and, in most
circumstances, preserved in undenatured ethanol or propylene glycol to
enable DNA analysis and future research (Majer and Framenau 2017).
Comprehensive sorting and taxonomic identification by invertebrate
specialists is generally required for inventory and environmental impact
assessment purposes. For long-term ecosystem monitoring (repeated
sampling of plots), samples are typically sorted at a coarse level into
orders or recognisable taxonomic units (RTUs), with an emphasis on
indicator species (Chinn 2017b).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
