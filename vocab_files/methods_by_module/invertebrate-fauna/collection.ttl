<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols</h2>
<p>The Invertebrate Fauna Module offers five standardised field sampling
protocols for terrestrial invertebrates: active search, wet-pitfall
trapping, rapid ground trapping, malaise trapping, and pan trapping
(<a href="#table-1">Table 1</a>). The protocols are straightforward and do not require specific
expertise. The field sampling protocols are typically undertaken within
the fauna plot, or within the core monitoring plot if a fauna plot is
not established.</p>
<p>Identification of specimens occurs post-field and typically requires
taxonomic expertise or DNA analysis. This module includes a post-field
protocol for sample curation (<a href="#table-1">Table 1</a>).</p>

Measurement goals of invertebrate fauna benchmarking and monitoring
studies.</h4></p>
<p>Source: Montgomery et al. (2021)</p>
<p><strong>Occurrence and distribution</strong>: Changes in occurrence
and distribution are important indicators of how shifts in underlying
processes affect organisms. Occurrence can also sometimes serve as
proxies for abundance (Royle and Nichols 2003). Estimating occurrence
and distribution requires, at minimum, the formal identification of a
taxon at a location (i.e., a presence), but the addition of data on what
taxa were not present (i.e., an absence), allows for a more powerful
analysis of occurrence. For insects, occurrence and distribution
monitoring is perhaps the most widespread benchmarking method (e.g.,
Chen et al. 2009; Boyes et al. 2019; Outhwaite et al. 2019), especially
for invasive species and in the context of shifting ranges due to
climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Phenology</strong>: Shifts in phenology can indicate changes
in the factors governing the timing of insect life cycles, from
temperature and precipitation patterns, to flowering periods in plants.
Shifts in insect phenology can cause mismatches with other taxa in their
communities, from plants to birds, and can have demographic consequences
for those taxa (Visser and Gienapp 2019). Estimating phenology typically
requires, at minimum, presence data for a taxon at a location repeatedly
over a short time span (i.e., a “season”), but presence and absence data
together allow for stronger inference. Changes in insect phenology are
poorly documented in most taxa, but recent interest in the effects of
climate change has spurred a larger focus on insect phenology in
monitoring efforts (Gimesi 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Abundance and biomass</strong>: Changes in abundance and
biomass, both measures of ecosystem function, are important for
understanding the health of the ecosystem as well as for conservation
and management. Estimating abundance and biomass typically requires
presence and absence data in addition to accurate counts of individuals
of each taxa. This form of monitoring is historically rare but has been
perhaps the most influential in spurring recent interest in insect
declines (Hallmann et al. 2017; Wepprich et al. 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Diversity and species composition</strong>: Changes in
measures of biodiversity, such as species diversity and composition,
indicate how communities respond to environmental change. Estimating
diversity and species composition typically requires presence and
absence data for multiple taxa in a community, with some expectation
that sampling is equally likely across taxa. Monitoring insect diversity
and composition is relatively common compared to abundance, biomass, and
phenological monitoring (e.g., Brooks et al. 2012; Valtonen et al.
2017).</p>

   <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Invertebrates constitute the majority of species richness, abundance
and biomass within terrestrial ecosystems (Oraby 2013; Barnett and Facey
2016; Evans 2016a; Williams 2020). An estimated 275,000 to 300,000
species of terrestrial invertebrate occur in Australia, including a
large proportion of endemic and undescribed species (Australian Museum
2021). They encompass a range of functional groups including herbivores,
pollinators, predators, parasitoids and detritivores, as well as
providing an important food source for other animals. They play critical
roles in ecosystem services and are involved in complex interactions
across multiple trophic levels (Lavelle et al. 2006; Prather et al.
2013; Kwok et al. 2016; Scudder 2017). However, few invertebrate groups
have been studied in detail and the ecology of most invertebrates,
particularly of their immature stages, remains poorly known (Williams
2020).</p>
<p>The lack of clear survey guidelines has been an impediment to the
broadscale implementation of terrestrial invertebrate surveys to date
(Ward and Larivière 2004; Majer and Framenau 2017; Montgomery <em>et
al.</em> 2021). Published studies highlight many variations exist in
sampling protocols (e.g. trap design and sampling technique,
configuration and intensity, preservatives used), and this limits the
ability to compare results across studies. In addition, sampling
protocols are often poorly reported, which limits the ability to re-use
methods (Majer and Framenau 2017; Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021), and
few studies include the necessary number of replicates and repeated
sampling to monitor long-term change (Montgomery <em>et al.</em>
2021).</p>
<p>Invertebrates are considered good indicators of environmental change
due to their abundance, diversity, ease of collection, ecological
importance, fast growth rates and population turnover, environmental
sensitivity and rapid responses to change (Pik <em>et al.</em> 2002;
Ward and Larivière 2004; Oraby 2013; Andersen <em>et al.</em> 2022).
Monitoring that incorporates a range of functional invertebrate groups
can identify patterns in composition, diversity and environmental
condition, at more meaningful scales than can be measured using plants
and vertebrate fauna (Pik <em>et al.</em> 2002; Andersen <em>et al.</em>

<p>It is common practice to select focal invertebrate taxa as
bio-indicators and surrogates for total biodiversity. There are no set
criteria for selecting which taxa to target, however factors to consider
include the:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>aims of the project and the specific purpose of
monitoring</p></li>
<li><p>influences that are thought to be acting and predicted taxa
response</p></li>
<li><p>sensitivity of the taxa to environmental change</p></li>
<li><p>biological reliability of the taxa (i.e. how well they represent
other taxa)</p></li>
<li><p>practicality of sampling (i.e. abundant, diverse, taxonomically
manageable, readily sampled)(McGeoch 1998; Andersen and Majer 2004;
Hodkinson and Jackson 2005; Oberprieler <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The invertebrate groups commonly selected for terrestrial ecosystem
monitoring include ants, ground beetles, sucking bugs, spiders and land
snails, and to a lesser extent butterflies (Andersen and Majer 2004;
Stanisic <em>et al.</em> 2005). Other invertebrate groups may be equally
useful for monitoring but are less well studied.</p>
<h3 id="which-sampling-methods">Which sampling methods</h3>
<p>There is no one-method-fits-all approach to sampling given the vast
number of invertebrate species and their different physical, biological
and ecological characteristics (Oliver and Beattie 1996). Many sampling
methods and variations of those methods exist, each with inherent biases
(Sherley and Stringer 2016). Choosing which sampling method/s to use
will depend on the project aims and the target taxa, and should consider
consistency, reliability, and precision (Spafford and Lortie 2013).</p>
<p>A review of invertebrate sampling methods was undertaken to inform
the selection of the five protocols (four passive and one active)
included in this module. The protocols were chosen because of their
efficacy across a range of terrestrial habitats, focus on taxa commonly
selected for ecosystem monitoring, simple methods that can be undertaken
by non-specialists, use of non-specialised equipment that is inexpensive
and readily available, and acceptance and use by the entomological
research community, enabling comparisons with existing datasets. Where
applicable, they follow existing, established protocols.</p>
<p>In general, active sampling is useful for creating a species
inventory and enables associations to be identified between
invertebrates and host plants/habitat components. Passive sampling can
be standardised more easily and captures a range of invertebrates with
minimal effort (Queensland Museum 2005; Bulbert <em>et al.</em> 2007;
Sherley and Evans 2016). Undertaking a range of protocols is recommended
(even for small project areas) as this maximises estimates of species
richness and abundance and ultimately increases the ability to detect
changes in response to disturbances and treatments (Cane <em>et al.</em>
2000; King and Porter 2005; Spafford and Lortie 2013; Berglund and
Milberg 2019; Basset <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>
<p>All protocols involve destructive sampling, deemed appropriate at
this point in time for definitive taxonomic identification, detecting
cryptic species, biogeography, future proofing, developing reference
libraries and for potential research (Upton <em>et al.</em> 2010;
Hoekman <em>et al.</em> 2017). Destructive methods can be problematic
for long-term studies because they can reduce the overall abundance of
invertebrates in the local area (Sherley and Stringer 2016; Montgomery
<em>et al.</em> 2021), impacting on repeat survey results. The effects
of destructive sampling are in part mitigated by the spatial separation
between monitoring plots, the restricted number of traps/sampling
locations per plot and temporal restrictions in sampling.</p>
<p>If a project has an existing invertebrate monitoring program, then
continued use of those methods is justified in that context; in such
cases the Targeted Survey Module can be used to record the data.</p>
<p>Terrestrial invertebrate communities that are dependent on or
restricted to specific vegetation or habitat types (e.g. SREs) are
likely to be most impacted by ecosystem change (Houghton et al. 2019).
Ecotones (i.e. where ecosystems converge) and riparian zones are
productive areas for collecting invertebrates (Upton et al. 2010), but
are not covered by the plot based approach. For these reasons, targeted
invertebrate surveys (using the Targeted Survey Module) may be important
to supplement plot-based methods.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="active-search"><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/e76e99ef-de1d-4387-9b2e-3455b9f9ff78">Active Search</a></h4>
<p>Active searching is complementary to the other protocols, as it can
reveal invertebrate taxa that may not be sampled by trapping methods.
The results may also trigger the need to undertake other survey
protocols and/or targeted surveys. Indirect invertebrate observations
via sign (e.g. ant nests, webs, cocoons, casings, shells, borings,
galls, burrows) can also be recorded. Observed invertebrates are
collected by hand, often assisted by hand-held apparatus (e.g. vial,
kill jar, aspirator, paint brush, forceps, collecting net, beating
tray). A representation of the different invertebrate
species/life-stages observed are photographed, collected, and preserved
for later identification and potential future analysis.</p>
<p>Active searching provides the opportunity to explore the range of
habitats and micro-habitats present within a plot, revealing
invertebrates from numerous taxa and functional groups, including
cryptic, conservation significant and short-range endemic taxa. Diurnal
and nocturnal searches are undertaken because they often produce very
different results in terms of the species sampled (Bulbert et al.
2007).</p>
<p>Soil and litter searches may reveal invertebrates of interest
additional to those found in wet pitfall traps, such as land snails,
mygalomorph spiders and burrows, millipedes, centipedes and scorpions
(Bamford et al. 2013). The use of hand-held sampling apparatus (e.g.
rake, net, beat stick, aspirator) is likely to increase the diversity of
taxa sampled. Active searching represents the best opportunity to detect
larger and more active invertebrates, especially at night (Southwood and
Henderson 2000).</p>
<p>Undertaking active search over a set time and area help to
standardise the method, however the data has limited use for ecosystem
monitoring because collection effort varies across the plot and among
different collectors, and the ease of collection is habitat dependent
(Bulbert et al. 2007). Because active search is primarily used for
inventory purposes, there is no need to remove large quantities of
invertebrates from the population (and sort through large samples) when
the data is not useful for site comparisons. If undertaking trapping
protocols, it is also likely that there will be duplicates in
sampling.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="wet-pitfall-trapping"><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/7e4bfab2-4056-4309-bd22-f070f6952bc0">Wet Pitfall Trapping</a></h4>
<p>The wet pitfall trapping protocol is based on the TERN Ant Monitoring
Protocol (Karan 2014). The trap size (4.5 cm diameter by 5.5 cm depth)
is a compromise between suitability for monitoring (Higgins and Lindgren
2012; Hohbein and Conway 2018) and minimising the risk to vertebrate
fauna (Bulbert et al. 2007; Pendola and New 2007; National Health and
Medical Research Council 2013; Brown and Matthews 2016; LeVan 2019;
Jackson 2020), and has been used extensively to monitor ants in
ecosystems across Australia (Andersen and Majer 2004). Wet pitfall
trapping is suitable across most terrestrial ecosystems where the
substrate can be dug to 6 cm. The protocol adopts a well-established
grid approach (Andersen <em>et al.</em> 2022) with a 10 m inter-trap
distance, which is the most common and recommended spacing for wet
pitfall trapping (Hohbein and Conway 2018). The wet pitfall traps are
set over multiple days, with the protocol designed to be co-timed with
other surveys.</p>
<p>Wet pitfall trapping captures a range of surface-active invertebrate
taxa, providing an opportunity to monitor functionally different groups.
It is a popular survey method to monitor bio-indicator species (Andersen
and Majer 2004; Oraby 2013). In Australia, ants are commonly selected as
indicators of habitat disturbance and ecological change because they are
ecologically dominant, readily sampled, have a wide distribution, and
are typically the most diverse and abundant taxa group recorded by wet
pitfall traps (Andersen and Majer 2004; Hoffmann 2010; Karan 2014; Lawes
<em>et al.</em> 2017; Sheikh <em>et al.</em> 2018). Ants occupy all
trophic levels, act as ecosystem engineers, feature in many mutualistic
interactions with plants, and are a key food resource for many
vertebrates. They are also Australia's best studied insect group in
terms of biogeography and community dynamics (Karan 2014; Andersen
<em>et al.</em> 2022). Other invertebrates (e.g. springtails, flies,
millipedes) will also be collected by wet pitfall traps, however it is
not the most efficient method for their collection (Brown and Matthews
2016; Sherley and Stringer 2016).</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="rapid-ground-trapping"><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/e9a8e65a-59d3-49f0-831d-094c568c5284">Rapid Ground Trapping</a></h4>
<p>Rapid ground trapping is focused on dominant ant species. The value
of the method is when undertaken across multiple projects and sites, to
provide an overall picture of the distribution and abundance of dominant
ant species and to detect change over time. The use of an attractant
bait enables the capture of many specimens in a short period of time,
making this a suitable protocol to undertake when there is insufficient
time to undertake other ground invertebrate survey methods. The quick
retrieval of the traps limits the number of ant species captured to
simplify sample processing (Alan Andersen, personal communication, 2
June 2023). Baits are typically selective in what they attract (Whitman
et al. 2019) so comparing the results for the different bait types will
help to inform future monitoring. Trapping bias must be considered when
reporting the results.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="pan-trapping"><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/666e5aa5-e545-4637-bc52-a296d647b303">Pan Trapping</a></h4>
<p>Pan trapping is most commonly used for monitoring bees and other
pollinators, and is generally a more effective method for trapping bees
than Malaise traps (Montgomery et al. 2021). Data on pollinators is
important to establish baselines, track population change, identify the
consequences of pollinator population declines, determine functionally
important species and guide conservation and restoration programs (Popic
et al. 2013). Rapid trapping (over 24 hours) is useful for inventory and
monitoring, however trapping over a longer duration will provide more
comprehensive results, given the flight period varies for different
pollinators, and may shift from year to year (Droege et al. 2016).</p>
<p>The number of traps per plot is considered adequate for estimating
species richness of bees (Shapiro et al. 2014). Pan traps are mostly
commonly placed 5 m apart and this distance is considered sufficient to
decrease bee competition among traps (Droege et al. 2016). The exact
position of the traps is not important given the attractant nature of
the method.</p>
<p>Pan trapping is complimentary with active search (including sweep
netting of flowering plants), as the composition of catches can be very
different (Cane et al. 2000; Berglund and Milberg 2019). Pan trapping is
also useful for sampling bees and elusive taxa when there are no flowers
present (e.g. after a fire) or in a ploughed paddock in an agricultural
setting (Cane et al. 2000).</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="malaise-trapping"><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/4a2c4309-da43-4ad4-b1eb-637d2e70580d">Malaise Trapping</a></h4>
<p>Malaise traps are tent-like traps that intercept insects in flight.
They predominantly catch flying insects and are the most effective
method for flies (Diptera) and wasps (Hymenoptera) (Schmidt et al. 2019;
Skvarla et al. 2020). The standard protocol is to set a single malaise
trap per plot, as this will likely yield catch results sufficient for
most purposes. The protocol is consistent with the requirements of the
Global Malaise Program (GMP).</p>
<p>Malaise traps are simple and easily operated, require the least
collection effort of all the invertebrate sampling methods, and can
result in diverse and abundant captures. Comparisons with other sampling
methods have shown that malaise traps reveal a significant proportion of
the local arthropod fauna (Evans 2016b; Whitman <em>et al.</em> 2019;
Centre of Biodiversity Genomics 2021). Once a trap is in place, it can
be left unattended for up to seven days before the collection bottle
needs changing (GMP 2019; D'Souza <em>et al.</em> 2021). The collection
bottle can be swapped or emptied without having to dismantle the trap
(Whitman <em>et al.</em> 2019). The collection bottles are not impacted
by rainfall like some other sampling methods, which means malaise
trapping is also suitable in areas with heavy rainfall (Skvarla <em>et
al.</em> 2020).</p>
<p>The biomass of samples provides a measure of flying insect
productivity and index of energy availability for higher trophic levels,
which can be used to identify trends over time and examine the influence
of environmental factors (Hallmann et al. 2017). The samples are wet
weighed to preserve them for future identification and DNA analysis
(Welti et al. 2022).</p>
<p>Malaise traps and wet pitfall traps are complementary techniques as
both collect highly diverse arthropod assemblages but have little
overlap in the species they sample (Skvarla et al. 2020).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;

  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>Terrestrial invertebrate fauna are diverse and prolific and have
adapted to occupy nearly every ecological niche (Australian Museum
2021). They include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Insects: ants, aphids, bees, beetles, bristletails, bugs,
butterflies, cicadas, cockroaches, crickets, fleas, flies, earwigs,
grasshoppers, lacewings, leafhoppers, lerps, lice, locusts, mantids,
moths, sawflies, scale insects, silverfish, stick insects, termites,
thrips, true bugs, wasps, weevils</p></li>
<li><p>Arachnids: mites, pseudoscorpions, scorpions, spiders,
ticks</p></li>
<li><p>Entognaths: springtails</p></li>
<li><p>Myriapods: centipedes and millipedes</p></li>
<li><p>Crustaceans: land-hoppers and slaters</p></li>
<li><p>Molluscs: slugs and snails</p></li>
<li><p>Annelids: earthworms and segmented worms</p></li>
<li><p>Nematodes: round worms</p></li>
<li><p>Platyhelminthes: flat worms</p></li>
<li><p>Opiliones: harvestmen</p></li>
<li><p>Onychophorans: velvet worms (see <a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a> for invertebrate
groups listed by common name).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The field sampling protocols in this module are not intended to cover
the full range of invertebrates present. The active search protocol is
typically undertaken at the start of a project to obtain a baseline
inventory of the invertebrate fauna taxa observed within a plot. The
four passive sampling protocols are aimed at specific invertebrate
groups, and provide a benchmark of the diversity and composition of
species present, informing the selection of key taxa and survey methods
for ongoing monitoring. The suitability of the protocols for sampling
commonly monitored invertebrate groups is summarised in <a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a>.</p>
<p>Repeat sampling is aimed at monitoring long-term trends, measuring
change in insect populations and communities over time, and gaining a
better understanding of the relationships underlying ecosystem function
and maintenance. Monitoring typically aims to measure change in:
occurrence and distribution, phenology, abundance and biomass, or
diversity and species composition. The spatiotemporal scale of sampling
depends on the focus of monitoring (Montgomery <em>et al.</em> (2021);
<a href="#appendix-3">Appendix 3</a>).</p>
<p>Invertebrate activity and trap efficiency are strongly influenced by
environmental factors such as weather, and the response to these factors
varies between taxa. Consistency in trapping location and timing is key
to obtaining comparable trapping results, and repeat sampling should be
undertaken at the same time of year, moon phase and during similar
weather and environmental conditions (Brown and Matthews 2016; Evans
2016b; Montgomery <em>et al.</em> 2021).</p>
<p>Accurately and consistently recording survey metadata is important
for repeatability and determining environmental relationships
(Montgomery et al. 2021). The standardised sampling design enables
comparison of species richness, composition and abundance within and
between plots and over time. The collection of plot-based vegetation
data enables analysis of trap results in relation to resource
availability.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/79296cab-a02f-420d-b260-17c0e8691499">Post-Field Sample Curation</a> protocol is relevant to all invertebrate
sampling. Invertebrate samples are retained, and in most circumstances
preserved in ≥95% undenatured ethanol or undiluted propylene glycol to
enable DNA analysis and future research (Majer and Framenau 2017). For
inventory and environmental impact assessment purposes, comprehensive
sorting and taxonomic identification by invertebrate specialists is
generally required. For long-term ecosystem monitoring (repeated
sampling of plots), samples are typically sorted at a coarse level into
orders or recognisable taxonomic units (RTUs), with an emphasis on
indicator species (Chinn 2017b).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
