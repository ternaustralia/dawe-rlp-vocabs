    dcterms:description """<p>
  The Invertebrate fauna module covers the procedures and guidelines for the
  field capture and preservation of terrestrial invertebrate fauna. This module
  is undertaken within fauna monitoring plots, adjacent to the vegetation and
  soil plots. Figure 1 shows the layout for the protocols that are undertaken at
  fixed locations within the plot.
</p>
<p>
  The module offers nine sampling protocols, targeting different invertebrate
  groups, as summarised in Table 2. The survey design and equipment for each
  protocol is standardised to ensure comparability of the results across
  projects. Where applicable, the protocols follow existing, established
  protocols and draw on current research. Users determine which of the nine
  protocols should be undertaken for their project needs; at a minimum the
  Active search and Micro-pitfall trapping protocols are undertaken at the start
  of a project, and Micro-pitfall trapping is repeated for monitoring.
  Implementing a range of complementary sampling protocols is strongly
  recommended, especially at the start of a project, to provide a baseline for
  inventory and monitoring. A post-field protocol covers the requirements for
  sample curation relevant to all protocols.
</p>
<p>
  The need to undertake the Invertebrate fauna module and, subsequently, the
  selection of sampling protocols is determined at the start of a project
  depending on the project objectives and their suitability for the situation.
  The results and project objectives should also inform which protocols to
  repeat, and how often. Repeat sampling using a range of methods increases the
  ability to detect different indicator species/functional groups, and therefore
  monitor trends.
</p>
<p>
  The protocols are ideally undertaken at the same time as the vertebrate fauna
  and vegetation and soil monitoring (with consideration given to season). The
  number of plots that require sampling will be determined at the start of the
  project (see Introduction Chapter). The repeat survey interval will depend on
  the project and the protocol. For comparability of the data, repeat surveys
  should be undertaken at the same time(s) of year, moon phase and during
  similar weather conditions. If the conditions are unsuitable, the sampling
  period is rescheduled or if this is not possible, any deviations in the
  sampling conditions are recorded.
</p>
<p>
  All invertebrate catch is preserved (for each trap and each trapping period)
  and stored for future analysis, generally as bulk, mixed samples (reflecting
  how they were collected in the field) until identification is required,
  available or affordable. Samples can be sorted (e.g. into RTU’s and
  life-stages). Specimen identification and DNA analysis will require expert
  input. The Invertebrate fauna module is linked to the following modules:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Plot selection and layout – before commencing the Invertebrate fauna
      module, the Plot selection and layout module must be completed to mark out
      the fauna plot with high accuracy using the Trimble® R1.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Soils – the soil samples collected for the Soils module provide the
      opportunity to detect invertebrate fauna through eDNA.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Vertebrate fauna – invertebrates may be opportunistically collected in
      vertebrate fauna traps. The selection of vertebrate fauna protocols (full
      or lite) may dictate the selection of micro-pitfall trapping protocol
      (full or lite). The timing of invertebrate sampling will need to consider
      any impacts on vertebrate fauna trapping (e.g. light trapping could
      influence vertebrate fauna trap results).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Targeted survey – the results of the Invertebrate fauna module sampling
      may be a trigger for targeted survey. If biosecurity (i.e. monitoring for
      potential incursion of exotic pests) is a specific focus, sampling methods
      outside of those listed in the Invertebrate fauna module may be more
      appropriate to enable rapid detection of taxa – use the Targeted Survey
      module in such instances.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Opportune – invertebrates can also be collected opportunistically (within
      and outside the plot) as part of the Opportunistic observations module.
      The opportunity for opportunistic sampling of invertebrates may occur
      during systematic sampling. The Opportunistic observations module can be
      quick-accessed from within the Invertebrate fauna module to record such
      records.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The invertebrate sampling results can be analysed in relation to attribute
  data collected in the adjoining vegetation plot. For example, the abundance of
  invertebrate captures could be analysed in relation to: plant type, plant
  cover and phenology collected as part of the Cover and Floristics modules;
  leaf litter cover collected as part of the Cover module; soil type and bulk
  density collected as part of the Soils module; coarse woody debris size and
  availability collected as part of the Coarse Woody Debris module; and soil
  char depth collected as part of the Fire module.

<p>Objectives and survey planning</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      A clear statement of the project objectives should underpin why this
      module is undertaken.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Refer to the decision trees (will be provided as part of the supporting
      information) to guide the selection of which protocol/s to undertake,
      based on the question/s being asked, the target taxa, the timeframe,
      budget, and expertise.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Determine a sampling procedure (timing, intensity, duration).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Plan how the invertebrate samples will be sorted and identified (Evans
      2016a).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Plot selection</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The fauna plot needs to be established prior to undertaking this module
      (refer to the Plot selection and layout and Vertebrate fauna modules). A
      pre-requisite when establishing the fauna plot is that the vegetation
      association is homogeneous and matches that within the adjoining
      vegetation and soils plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For baseline inventory, plots are chosen to cover the major vegetation
      associations present within a project area, providing spatial coverage
      across the project area, and focusing on areas that represent the most
      natural (undisturbed) conditions. For ongoing monitoring, plot selection
      will depend on the question/s being asked and the impact footprint, and
      may include a range of conditions and treatments (e.g. design) (Hoekman et
      al. 2017).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Terrestrial invertebrate communities that are dependent on or restricted
      to specific vegetation or habitat types (e.g. SREs) are likely to be most
      impacted by ecosystem change (Houghton et al. 2019). Ecotones (i.e. where
      ecosystems converge) and riparian zones are productive areas for
      collecting invertebrates (Upton et al. 2010), but are not covered by the
      plot based approach. For these reasons, targeted (outside of plot)
      invertebrate survey may be important to supplement the plot-based results.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Permits</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      There are no specific permit requirements for collecting terrestrial
      invertebrates in Australia, unless they are a listed species at a state or
      Commonwealth level. A scientific permit is required if undertaking work in
      a protected area. Special permit requirements may apply on offshore
      islands (e.g. Lord Howe Island, Christmas Island and Macquarie Island)
      because of their natural heritage value. Permits may also be required if
      the sampling method poses a risk to vertebrate fauna. Refer to the
      relevant authority in the relevant State or Territory (Upton et al. 2010).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The survey coordinator must check that all scientific permit and animal
      ethics requirements are being met. Refer to the Introduction chapter.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Equipment</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The protocols require the use of the Mobile App and the Trimble® R1. For
      instructions on how to operate the Trimble® R1 refer to the General
      Introduction Chapter. The guidelines below are relevant to all
      invertebrate fauna protocols.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The specific invertebrate collecting equipment identified in this module
      must be used to standardise the results. Most of the equipment can be
      sourced from Australian Entomological Supplies (online). The relevant
      state/local environmental authority may have equipment available for hire.
      Refer to each of the protocols below for a list of the equipment required.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Trimble® R1 is the preferred method for recording the location of
      invertebrate sampling, as this provides a high level of accuracy that is
      important for repeat monitoring.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      DAWE and TERN have no affiliation with any of the suppliers listed. Where
      a specific supplier is noted, this is simply for convenience, and
      alternatives can be sourced. For a list of entomological suppliers, refer
      to (Upton et al. 2010) (p75).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The permit conditions in some jurisdictions require fauna survey equipment
      that is used to capture animals to be clearly labelled (e.g., organisation
      name, contact number and/or permit number). Check your permit conditions
      for any details that may be required.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is important to clean equipment thoroughly when collecting samples for
      DNA analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Traps/survey equipment must be removed at the completion of a survey
      event.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Safety</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Users should avoid working in the field alone and should carry portable
      communication devices (mobiles, UHF radios), especially when working in
      remote areas.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Chemicals are used for killing and preserving invertebrates, notably ethyl
      acetate, ethanol (ethyl alcohol) and propylene glycol.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ethanol and ethyl acetate are highly flammable (both in liquid and vapour
      form). Ethanol is a mild poison (made by distillation with benzene which
      causes cancer, not suitability for human consumption). Breathing vapours
      of ethyl acetate may cause drowsiness and dizziness, and irritate the
      eyes, throat and skin. Repeated contact causes defatting of the skin with
      irritation, dryness, and cracking, and can be seriously damaging to
      internal organs in the case of prolonged exposure.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Propylene glycol (antifreeze) is generally regarded as safe (not suitable
      for human consumption but environmentally non-toxic). It can be safely
      disposed of on soil or in water, although check the disposal requirements
      as they may vary between jurisdictions. Do not use ethylene glycol
      antifreeze as it is poisonous, toxic and requires disposal at a licenced
      facility.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      MSDS must be printed and stored with any chemicals, and strict safety
      protocols followed. Permits may be required regarding their use and
      transport.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Weather</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The suitability of the weather conditions for the invertebrate sampling
      methods should be assessed prior to a field trip. Adjustments may be
      necessary to the trip dates or survey days within the trip.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If possible, an onsite automatic weather station should be installed for
      the duration of a sampling event, to record daily temperatures, rainfall
      and humidity. A weather station is established as part of the Vertebrate
      fauna module (full protocol). For invertebrate survey, the weather station
      is ideally placed near the ground surface within the fauna plot.
      Otherwise, data should be obtained from the nearest weather station.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Categorical weather data (drop-down selections for wind, rain,
      temperature, sun/cloud) is also recorded for each protocol. The data
      fields will be pre-filled if weather data has already been recorded for
      the day, with the option to update the entries to match the prevailing
      conditions.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Sampling, preservation, identification and storage</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is helpful to be familiar with the common invertebrate orders before
      conducting surveys. There are a number of useful web resources available,
      such as:
    </p>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>http://anic.ento.csiro.au/insectfamilies/</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>https://australian.museum/learn/teachers/learning/bugwise/</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A list of useful books and identification keys is provided in Upton et
        al. (2010).
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Experience visually identifying invertebrates in the field is not
      essential for this module as all captures are collected for later
      identification, either based on morphology or via DNA analysis. This means
      it is of utmost importance that the samples are appropriately stored.
      Preservation and storage requirements are summarized in Section 10.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Liaise with the receiving museum or relevant institution prior to
      commencing this module, to discuss:
    </p>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>specific collection, preservation and storage requirements</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        the availability and cost of taxonomic identification and genetic
        expertise
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>options for long-term storage.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ethyl acetate is used as standard euthanising chemical in the field, for
      active survey methods or where specimens are dry collected. For
      instructions on how to make a kill jar, refer to Upton et al. (2010).
      Freezing is the most humane method of killing insects if this option is
      available. Some taxa (e.g. moths and butterflies) are best kept alive and
      put in a freezer as soon as practical after trapping to preserve their
      condition (Sherley and Evans 2016).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Appropriate preservation and storage of samples is of utmost importance to
      ensure their future value. High grade (95% and above) ethanol and
      undiluted propylene glycol are adopted as the standard preservative
      solutions, for a killing agent through to long-term storage, based on
      their DNA preservability, low toxicity, availability and cost (Nakamura et
      al. 2020). Ethanol is the traditional killing agent of choice however
      ppropylene glycol has the benefit of being less likely to evaporate in the
      field, less flammable, odourless, cheaper, and easier to transport.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RNAlater® is another preservative option that can be explored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Trapping results can differ significant depending on the killing agent
      used (Gossner et al. 2016). The relative influence of the preservatives on
      captures is unknown, however the potential for related bias is true for
      any preservative that is used (Skvarla et al. 2014). Given propylene
      glycol is odourless it may be a better option as a killing agent in traps,
      however this remains untested.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Samples should not be exposed to prolonged sunlight and heat in the field
      as they can degrade, ethanol can evaporate, and propylene glycol can
      decompose into water, acetone and isopropanol. The effects generally lead
      to lower DNA integrity (Weigand et al. 2021). Samples can be kept in a
      cooler or refrigerator if available.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Timing</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The timing of repeat invertebrate surveys should be standardised as much
      as possible to reduce the effect of environmental factors and seasonal
      variability on the results. Ideally, sampling is undertaken during the
      same time period, the same moon phase, and the same (as much as possible)
      weather conditions, for the same duration each sampling event.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Invertebrate sampling is ideally undertaken during the same period as
      vertebrate fauna surveys, so trends can be assessed, and co-timed with the
      vegetation and soil monitoring, so the results can be analysed with
      respect to available plant and litter resources in the local landscape.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Timing of surveys for conservation significant and short range endemic
      invertebrate fauna should follow also follow existing guidelines (EPA
      2016; Australian Government Department of Agriculture Water and the
      Environment 2021).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The time of day can be important. Early mornings can be productive as
      insects are actively feeding as the day warms up. Insect activity
      typically declines in hot weather (Upton et al. 2010).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Invertebrates can respond to change quicker than plants and animals, and
      their presence and movements strongly linked to phenological events, so
      intra-annual sampling covering a range of temporal and meteorological
      conditions will provide more comprehensive results (Battelle 2020; Grange
      et al. 2021).

<p>Analysis</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The approach and expertise required to statistically analyse collected
      data and interpret DNA analyses should be determined at the start of a
      project and factored into the costs.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Reporting on the survey results may be a requirement of scientific permits
      and animal ethics approval.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Any vertebrate fauna by-catch/trap deaths must be documented. Ensure the
      trap type, date, time, species and any comments relevant to the cause are
      recorded. This information will be required for animal ethics and
      scientific permit report returns, as well as any specific reporting
      mechanisms required by the relevant jurisdiction. Assess the suitability
      of animal vertebrate fauna by-catch for whole specimen vouchering (see the
      Vertebrate fauna module).
