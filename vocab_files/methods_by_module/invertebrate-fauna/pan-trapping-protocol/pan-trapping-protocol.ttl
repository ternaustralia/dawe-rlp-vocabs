    dcterms:description """<p>
  Pan traps are set in two fixed location transects of 12 traps, spaced 5 metres
  apart (see figure) and left out for up to 24 hours if using water with
  detergent, or up to seven days if using propylene glycol. All the traps used
  within a project must be the same dimensions. Yellow is the standard colour of
  pan traps used to attract day-active insects. If using white and blue pans as
  well, the trap colours are alternated in a repeat pattern (blue, yellow,
  white). The pans are placed either directly on the ground or elevated off the
  ground where vegetation obscures them from sight (LeBuhn et al. 2016). This
  protocol should be undertaken on sunny or only partially cloudy days, with
  minimal wind and preferably no rain (Droege et al. 2016; LeBuhn et al. 2016).

      If required, use flourescent paint to paint the inside of the required
      number of pans based on the colours to be used (yellow, blue). Ensure even

      For long-term trapping, create 4-5 small pin-holes spaced evenly around

      Pan traps are set out in two transects of 12 bowls, spaced 5 metres apart
      (24 pans in total). The standard protocol is to use yellow pans. If other
      colours (blue and white) are also being used, these should be alternated
      along the transect (blue, yellow, white), and the colour and location of
      each trap recorded.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use flagging tape to mark the start and the end pan trap within the
      transect. The flagging tape should be visible from a distance (e.g. pegged
      to a nearby tree).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Navigate to where the pan trap transects will be positioned, either by
      using the mapping interface in the App and Trimble® R1 or manually by
      using a compass and surveyors tape measure, or by pacing out the distance.
      To use the App and Trimble® R1, select Navigate to trap location and the
      mapping interface in the App will show your location in relation to the
      default pre-determined trap locations (see Figure 1).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Start at one end of the pan trap line and establish each trap in order.

</ul>
<p>For each trap:</p>
<ol start="11">
  <li>
    <p>
      Place the pan level on the ground, in an exposed (full sun) location,
      where there is no overhanging vegetation. Use small stakes to hold down
      the pan if there is a risk of it being blown over; ensure the ends of the
      stakes do not extend over the pan and provide an escape for trapped
      insects. The idea is to position the traps within the vegetation but at a
      location where they will be visible to insects flying above (not
      necessarily above the vegetation canopy (Droege et al. 2016).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the ground vegetation is obscuring the sight of the pan, install a
      stand to elevate the trap so that the bottom of the pan is just above
      (e.g. 2.5 cm) the level of the ground or underlying substrate (e.g. matted
      down grass). If undertaking repeat monitoring, stands may be installed at
      each trap location. Write the Trap ID on the stand.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Pour the liquid solution into the pan until about three quarters full; for
      short-term monitoring (&lt;24 hours), use water-dishwashing liquid
      solution. For longer-term monitoring, use undiluted propylene glycol. Pans
      can either be left out for any 24 hour period of good weather or placed
      out prior to when bees are active in the morning and collected after they
      have become inactive in the afternoon. For longer-term monitoring, pans
      can be left for up to two weeks, but may need to be checked and liquid
      topped up during the survey period.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Top up the sample containers with 95% ethanol or undiluted propylene
      glycol to prevent fluid splashing around and damaging the samples in the
      container. Return the lid and ensure it is screwed on tightly. For
      additional measure, place a small sticker barcode (duplicate code as that
      in the sample) on the side or base of the sample container – this enables
      the sample information to be readily retrieved without having to open the
      container and remove the label from the fluid for scanning. Note: only one
      barcode is allocated to a sample. For additional measure, write the Plot

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If monitoring is to be completed in one day, set the traps in the morning
      and retrieve them shortly before sunset (Droege et al. 2016).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Microhabitat detail is not collected for this protocol given the
      attractant nature of the method.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Data from the adjoining vegetation plot will provide an indication of the
      number of floral resources available, when pan trapping is undertaken
      within the same monitoring period. Phenology data is also collected for
      the Sweep netting protocol.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When selecting trap locations, consider vegetation growth and other
      activities that might be an issue if undertaking repeat monitoring (Droege
      et al. 2016).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If flagging tape is used, be mindful of placement too close to traps as
      these may bias sampling by attracting or deterring bees. Avoid using tape
      that is the same colour as the traps (Droege et al. 2016).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For repeat monitoring, the pan traps should be repainted if the colour is
      fading as this can affect the trap results (Droege et al. 2016).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The pans do not need to be placed near flowers as bees will often travel
      in search of flowers. Studies have shown that trap results can actually be
      less when floral resources are present (Cane et al. 2000).
    </p>

      Propylene glycol is used in place of soapy water if undertaking trapping
      for longer than 24 hours. Assess the suitability of the weather before
      undertaking pan trapping over multiple days, as heavy rain can splash
      trapped invertebrates out of the pan trap or result in pans overflowing.
      Tiny overflow holes can be created in the top of the pan traps to let
      water out (LeBuhn et al. 2016).

      Any type of dish or laundry detergent can be used, except those with
      citrus scent added as this will decrease the number of bees caught.
      Laundry detergent is generally better than dish soap as it does not create
      many suds on top of the water (LeBuhn et al. 2016).

      Traps filled with soapy water should not be left for more than 24 hours
      because they are generally easy to disturb and also the water will
      evaporate, especially in hot conditions (Bulbert et al. 2007).

      Unused soapy water can be disposed of by pouring down the drain. Used
      soapy water from pan traps can be disposed of by pouring out onto the
      ground, away from aquatic environments (MacKenzie et al. 2002).

      Sieving is a common practice that speeds up specimen processing in the
      field, but can damage small, fragile taxa such as aphids (Montgomery et
      al. 2021). Do a quick check of the invertebrates present before sieving to
      ensure samples will not be damaged.

      The loss of individual traps is not an issue if only one or two are lost,
      as long as this information is properly documented. At the end of the
      collection process, during the analysis of the data, divide the number of
      captures by the number of bowls available to account for any losses.

      Bee data can be sent to Dr G. Lebuhn at the San
      Francisco State University, for collation and integration into a global
      meta-analysis of bee monitoring (see
      https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/pollination/docs/Data_Sheet_FINAL.xlsx).

      Post-field processing may include: specimen washing and drying, sorting,
      pinning, labelling and identifying. Refer to LeBuhn et al. (2016) for
      instructions. A video that demonstrates how to dry bees can be viewed at
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=935jlJep6go.

      Bee identification is difficult in most circumstances, so any specimens
      collected should be sent to experts for identification, at least at the
      start of a project (LeBuhn et al. 2016).
