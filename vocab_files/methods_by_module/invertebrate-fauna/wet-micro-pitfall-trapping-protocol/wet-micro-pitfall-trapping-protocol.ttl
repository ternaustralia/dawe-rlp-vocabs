    a skos:Concept ;
    dcterms:description """<p>
  The pitfall traps used for invertebrate sampling are referred to as
  ‘micro-pitfall traps’, as distinct from the pitfall traps used for vertebrate
  fauna trapping. Micro-pitfalls are essentially a small container dug into the
  ground, flush with the surface, so anything crawling over the edge of the
  container falls in and cannot escape (Whitman et al. 2019). A liquid
  preservative is added to the traps (hence the term ‘wet’ micro-pitfall), to
  rapidly kill and preserve the invertebrates that fall in.
</p>
<p>
  Micro-pitfall trapping is the most common and efficient passive survey method
  for non-flying terrestrial (epigeic) arthropods, in particular ants
  (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), spiders (Araenae) and ground beetles (Coleoptera,
  especially Carabidae and Staphylinidae) (Southwood and Henderson 2000; Bulbert
  et al. 2007; Callan et al. 2011; Skvarla et al. 2014; Brown and Matthews 2016;
  Sherley and Stringer 2016). Other invertebrates (e.g. springtails, flies,
  millipedes) will also be collected by pitfall traps, however it is not the
  most efficient method for their collection.
</p>
<p>
  The micro-pitfall trap design adopted for this protocol is based on Brown and
  Matthews (2016) and consists of a transparent outer cup (10 cm diameter x 10
  cm depth), an inner screw top sampling container pre-filled with liquid
  preservative that fits inside the outer cup, a transparent funnel that fits
  inside the outer cup, and a transparent cover (15 cm diameter) positioned
  above the trap (see Figure). Use of a guidance barrier is optional.
</p>
<p>
  The micro-pitfall trapping protocol is suitable across terrestrial ecosystem
  types, anywhere where the substrate can be dug to at least 10 cm (Montgomery
  et al. 2021). Pitfall trapping is best undertaken when overall invertebrate
  activity peaks, typically around spring when conditions are warm and at least
  some soil moisture is present. Some invertebrate groups (e.g. slaters,
  millipedes) may only be active in the cool, wet winter months and some have
  different annual cycles (e.g. trapdoor spiders), thus there is merit in
  trapping at different times of the year (Bamford et al. 2013).
</p>
<p>
  A full and lite protocol option is provided, in line with the Vertebrate fauna
  module (see Table). Whilst the full protocol is the recommended approach,
  users may opt to undertake the lite protocol when undertaking the lite
  protocol of the Vertebrate fauna module. The standard layout of pitfall lines
  is shown in Figure 1.

<p><strong>Protocol overview</strong></p>
<p>
  The micro-pitfall trap design consists of a transparent outer cup (10 cm
  diameter x 10 cm depth), an inner sampling container, a transparent funnel, a
  transparent cover (15 cm diameter) and a cross-design transparent barrier
  (optional).
</p>
<p>
  For the full protocol, a total of 12 micro-pitfall traps are established in
  two lines of six traps, one trap line in each half of the plot. For the lite
  protocol, 6 micro-pitfall traps are established in one line (one half of the
  plot). The traps are placed 10 m apart, 10 m away from and parallel to the
  vertebrate fauna pitfall trap lines, on the inner sides, such that the two
  micro-pitfall lines are 30 m apart (see Figure 1). The full protocol is the
  recommended approach where possible.
</p>
<p>
  For the lite protocol, a total of 6 micro-pitfall traps are established in one
  line of six traps (as above), parallel to the vertebrate pitfall trap line.
  The lite protocol can be undertaken when undertaking the lite version of the
  Vertebrate fauna module.
</p>
<p>
  The number and location of traps and the trapping duration should be
  consistent for repeat sampling. All captured invertebrates are removed at the
  end of the trapping period and stored for later identification.

    <p>
      Carry the Mobile device, Trimble® R1, trap materials and equipment to
      install traps, to the fauna plot, avoiding walking through the vegetation
      plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the Fauna Plot ID (nearest plot should appear at top of the

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the Observers, being the person/s responsible for trap set-up

      multiple selections OK, manual entry override if necessary)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the Weather (select a category for wind, rain, temperature,
      sun/cloud, from the drop-down lists). Quantitative weather data can be
      later uploaded if a weather station is in use.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Navigate to where the two (full protocol), or one (lite protocol),
      micro-pitfall line/s will be positioned, either by using the App and
      Trimble® R1, or manually by using a surveyors tape measure and compass. To
      use the App and Trimble® R1, select Navigate to trap location and the
      mapping interface in the App will show your location in relation to the
      default pre-determined trap locations. Start at one end of the
      micro-pitfall line and establish each trap in order. Make adjustments to
      the spatial placement as necessary, e.g. to avoid ant nests or key ant
      activity areas, or areas of foot traffic, obvious vertebrate fauna
      travelways (see Guidelines).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>For each micro-pitfall trap:</p>
<ol start="9">
  <li>
    <p>
      For each trap location, under Trap set-up, select Add trap. Select the
      Trap ID from the drop-down menu (the trap line/trap number, e.g. MP1-1 or
      manually enter).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Hold Trimble® R1 directly over the trap location (to obtain best
      positional accuracy), select Record trap location. The GPS location will
      be automatically recorded and will be shown on the mapping interface. A
      warning message will appear if the accuracy is less than +/- 5m, prompting
      the user to repeat this step.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Before disturbing the trap location, record the Substrate type where the
      trap will be located (select from drop-down list, e.g. bareground,
      litter).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If undertaking the Soil sampling (eDNA) protocol, sterilise the digging
      equipment (handtrowel or small shovel) by spraying with methylated spirits
      and allowing it to air dry, before and in between each sample collection,
      to ensure it is not contaminated with soil from another location.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use a hand trowel or small shovel to dig a small hole to just accommodate
      where the micro-pitfall trap is to be located (approximately 10 cm
      diameter by 10 cm deep). Try not to dig the hole much wider than the cup.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If undertaking the Soil sampling (eDNA) protocol, retain the soil sample –
      refer to the Soil sampling (eDNA) protocol for instructions. Select eDNA
      sample within this protocol and it will link to the Soil sampling
      protocol. Select Collect soil sample and Scan barcode. This will link the
      soil sample back to the pitfall location/trap ID.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To install the micro-pitfall trap, set two identical plastic cups
      (approximately 10 cm diameter by 10 cm depth), one nested inside the
      other, into the hole so the top rim of the outer cup is level with the
      ground. The inner cup is used to prevent debris falling into the trap
      during set-up, and is removed after set-up. Pack the soil back firmly
      around the outer cup so the rim is flush with the surface of the ground.
      If the ground is rocky it may be necessary to fill around the pitfall with
      stones before replacing the dirt. There should be no gaps between the soil
      and the top of the outer cup. The top of the cup, if anything, should be
      slightly below the surface of the ground. Make sure there is no debris
      (e.g. leaf litter, sticks) in the immediate trap vicinity that could fall
      in and foul sample or provide a means of escape for invertebrates. Remove
      the inner cup, along with any debris that has fallen in the cup.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Unscrew the lid of the inner sampling container (pre-filled with 100 ml
      undiluted propylene glycol) and carefully place the container inside the
      cup, taking care not to spill the liquid. Take the lids (keep them all
      together in a plastic snaplock bag until the traps are rechecked).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place the funnel (if using) over the inner sampling container, ensuring
      the top of the funnel sits snugly below the rim of the cup.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Position the three pegs around the rim of the inverted petri dish and
      place the dish centrally over the pitfall trap as a cover, to protect the
      trap from rain and debris.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Write the trap number on the cover (MP1-1 to MP1-6, or MP2-1 to MP2-6).

    <p>
      Checking the traps during the trapping period may be necessary,
      particularly if there has been inclement weather (e.g. extreme heat, windy
      conditions, rain), to ensure there is adequate preserving liquid, that
      covers are still properly in place, that rain has not impacted the traps.
      If samples are fouled or rain has filled the trap, the sample collection
      container needs to be removed from the trap, and the samples sieved by
      pouring onto a chux cloth. The samples are then placed into a fresh
      container of undiluted propylene glycol. A replacement collection
      container with undiluted propylene glycol should be placed in the trap.

      Select Add photo and take a photo looking down (into the sample container
      with the lid off), with the barcode placed alongside the container (not in
      the container), so it is visible in the photo (place a blank piece of
      white paper underneath the container for the best photo).
    </p>

  <li>
    <p>
      Provide a brief description for each photo (default descriptions available

      On the small thermal barcode label, manually write the following
      information with lead pencil (do not use pen or marking pen as the ink
      will dissolve), in approximately size 4 font: Project name, Plot ID, Trap
      ID, date (start and end) and collector. Place into the preserving fluid
      into the sampling container.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Top up the sample containers with undiluted propylene glycol to prevent
      fluid splashing around and damaging the samples in the container. Return
      the lid and ensure it is screwed on tightly. For additional measure, a
      small sticker barcode (duplicate of the code in the sample) is placed on
      the side or base of the sample container – this enables the sample
      information to be readily retrieved without having to open the container
      and remove the label from the fluid for scanning. Note: only one barcode
      is allocated to a sample.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Store the containers in a cool location out of direct light.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Any excess/used propylene glycol should be stored appropriately and
      discarded in an environmentally safe way in line with permit and site
      requirements (ideally discarded off-site).

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure all surveyors avoid walking through the Vegetation and Soils Plot
      to access the Fauna Plot during trap installation, trap checks and
      removal. All foot traffic must go around the plot. This is important to
      maintain the integrity of the Vegetation and Soils Plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Commence this protocol on the first day of a monitoring event,
      establishing traps as soon as possible, to maximise the time they are
      deployed (recommended minimum is five days).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Refer to Section 3 General Survey Guidelines regarding safety related to
      the preservative liquids used.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      There will likely be instances (e.g. in rainforest situations) where the
      diameter/depth of the traps is unsuitable for collecting large arthropods,
      however the same biases apply globally (Brown and Matthews 2016) and such
      species may be detected by vertebrate pitfall traps or using a targeted
      approach.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Studies have shown that some invertebrates, particularly ants, are
      attracted to freshly-disturbed soil around a newly-installed pitfall trap
      which can lead to their over-representation in samples – this is referred
      to as a ‘digging-in effect’ (Greenslade 1973). Traps can be left unopened
      (e.g., for 24 hours) to avoid such effects (Callan et al. 2011). In such
      cases, the trap set-up and trap open dates will be different. Delayed
      opening of traps is not a standard component of the protocol, as the idea
      is to maximise captures within the available field time, and the data can
      be analysed to exclude the first trap night results if necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Attractants/baits can be very effective for capturing large numbers of
      specimens, but are not included in the protocols because they are
      typically selective in what they will attract (Whitman et al. 2019), can
      promote trap disturbance by vertebrate fauna (Montgomery et al. 2021), and
      create an additional bias, confounding the results.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Trap set-up</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Traps can be placed amongst or alongside natural cover, i.e., under or
      alongside shrubs, to aid protection from direct sunlight. Ensure that
      foliage will not brush across the cover/trap.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take care to identify and avoid potential ant nest locations and ant
      foraging trails as this may skew the results. This may mean moving the
      trap several metres from the ideal trap line alignment.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a hard substrate is encountered when installing pitfalls, and digging
      the hole is slow and overly time-consuming, try an alternative nearby
      location. Failing this, the soil can be mounded up around the cup to
      enable the top to be flush with the top of the soil surface.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure any discrepancies from the standard trap array are recorded (the
      location will be recorded via the App, and the comments field can be used
      to make any relevant notes).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Flag the location of each trap with flagging tape so it can easily be
      found in the field, ensuring the flag is clearly visible, particularly
      from the angle of which it will be approached during trap checking. A good
      technique is to double flag (2 strips of flagging tape, ~20 cm apart) the
      start and end of each line, providing a quick visual cue for the surveyor.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is recommended to set the traps out in numerical order and permanently
      write numbers on the cover and flagging tape to assist with trap checks
      and removal, back-tracking if a number is skipped.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Checking and removing traps</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Traps should be checked/removed in sequence to minimise the risk of
      missing a trap. All traps must be accounted for when checked/removed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Traps must be checked after seven days, under normal average weather
      conditions, or more frequently under hot/cold/raining conditions. Conduct
      any maintenance of the traps when checking (e.g., ensuring the rim of the
      pitfalls is flush with the ground, there are no gaps, no branches laying
      across, the cover and funnel are in the correct position, that there is
      adequate preservative in trap).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Unless explicitly permitted, all traps must be removed at the conclusion
      of each trapping session. Permanent micro-pitfalls may be left in situ
      following the conditions specified in the scientific permit and animal
      ethics approvals.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Wet micro-pitfall traps can pose a bycatch risk to small non-target
      vertebrates such as lizards, frogs and small mammals. At the start of the
      project, the suitability of micro-pitfall trapping should be assessed
      based on the risk of potential by-catch, considering the fauna (common and
      threatened) known to be present at the site. Use of a funnel within the
      trap is recommended as a standard design feature to minimise the
      inadvertent capture of vertebrates.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Any vertebrate bycatch must be recorded (use Opportunistic observation
      module) and reported to the relevant government agency as a condition of
      the scientific permit. Deceased vertebrate captures should be preserved
      and provided to the local museum (refer to the Vertebrate fauna module for
      guidelines). The continued use of wet micro-pitfall traps should be
      reviewed in such instances.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Any invertebrate fauna caught in vertebrate fauna traps (e.g., pitfalls,
      Elliot’s) can also be collected (use Opportunistic observation module).
