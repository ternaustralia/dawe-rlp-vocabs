<p>Preserving samples</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Preservation type (wet or dry) will depend on the taxa type and the
      intended use of the samples. In most cases, a wet preservation approach is
      adopted, for efficiency in the field and post field processing, and so the
      samples are suitable for future DNA extraction.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Based on current information, the standard solution for long-term storage
      is high concentration (95% and above) ethanol or undiluted propylene
      glycol. Both ethanol and propylene glycol act as dehydrating agents, are
      largely non-toxic, readily available and suitable for field collection
      through to long-term storage (Whitman et al. 2019; Nakamura et al. 2020).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Some studies show propylene glycol to have superior DNA preservability
      over ethanol however longer-term testing of DNA degradation effects is
      required (Nakamura et al. 2020; Weigand et al. 2021). Propylene glycol
      also acts as a cryoprotectant if the specimens will be frozen (Whitman et
      al. 2019).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      RNAlater® is an alternative to ethanol and propylene glycol that can also
      be explored. RNAlater® is an aqueous, non-toxic storage reagent that also
      has potential for broadscale preservative use. It is currently a more
      expensive option but has advantages over propylene glycol and ethanol for
      DNA-extraction and dissection.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The suitability of which preservative to use for long-term storage should
      be assessed on a case by case basis, in consultation with the relevant
      museum or institution. Research is continually advancing into the
      preservation ability of the options and the techniques to extract DNA from
      samples (Montgomery et al. 2021).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Detailed instructions for wet and dry preservation can be found in Upton
      et al. (2010).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Identifying samples</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Preference is given to expert identification, via either DNA analysis or
      morphology. The procedures and requirements for lodging specimens with a
      museum, other institution or specialist vary. Make contact prior to
      discuss:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>fees</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>preference for all samples or representative subset only</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>requirements for preservation, preparation, sorting and labelling</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>timeframe for identification and return of samples</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>where type specimens will be deposited</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>number and identify of specimens to be retained by the specialist</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>return shipping.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Samples can be pre-sorted, to decrease costs and the time required of
      specialists (see Section 13.1.6).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Begin identifications using the invertebrate body form or shape.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Identification may require viewing specimens under a microscope. Refer to
      Upton et al. (2010) for recommended microscope setups.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A list of useful invertebrate reference books and identification keys is
      provided in Upton et al. (2010).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Fully identified species should be listed by genus and species, e.g.
      Ogyris abrota.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Species identified to genus only should be listed as e.g. Ogyris sp.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Morphospecies should be listed by letter: e.g. Ogyris sp. A, Ogyris sp. B.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Samples should be identified only to the level of confidence in the
      identification (i.e. if the genus is unknown, identify to the level of
      family, or if family is unknown, identify to the level of order).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Insect larvae are not always easy to identify to the level of order, in
      which case they should be assigned simply as &quot;larvae&quot;.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Identification at the level of morphospecies or RTU is often adequate for
      monitoring purposes (Oliver and Beattie 1996; Oraby 2013).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Update the records in the App to track the location of the samples and the
      status of the identifications.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Sorting samples</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      All protocols involve the collection of bulk mixed samples, containing
      multiple taxa and individuals from each trap/location.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Samples collected from each trap/location are stored separately to
      facilitate trap level analyses.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Samples may be sorted and split into separate vials, before or after
      expert processing. The origin of the samples (trap/location) is retained
      by linked barcode references.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Samples are typically sorted by non-specialists into RTUs (e.g.
      morphospecies) by making external morphological comparisons between
      specimens, however this still requires a certain level of technical skill.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Samples can also be sorted by genus, family, order, size, functional group
      or life-stage. Samples may be selectively sorted, e.g. separating the taxa
      of interest for further analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Samples are placed in plastic trays or petri dishes for sorting, and
      soft-nose forceps are used to handle the specimens. Ensure there is enough
      preservative on the tray/dish so that the specimens do not dry out.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Efficiency and accuracy are required when sorting large volumes of wet
      specimens. It may be easiest to start with the largest specimens, or the
      most abundant. Separate lookalike specimens into zones of the sorting tray
      or transfer into new trays (Chinn 2017a), ensuring that each tray has
      enough preservative to prevent the specimens from drying out.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Counts (actual or estimate) can be recorded during the sorting process to
      provide an indication of the number of species, morphospecies or RTU
      collected and their abundance. It is helpful to use a counter when dealing
      with large volumes of specimens.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To account for individual samples that were later reidentified, the final
      abundance for a species is the original sorting sample count minus the
      number of individuals given a new ID.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Inspect samples obtained from leaf litter extraction under a microscope,
      as there may be meso and microfauna present that are not otherwise
      visible.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Photographing samples</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Include a scale card in photos.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Photos can be taken during the sorting process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A microscope camera can be used to obtain high resolution photos.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Upload any photos collected outside of the App to the appropriate record.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Preparing samples</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      This module is predominantly focused on wet preservation of samples, to
      facilitate future DNA analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Specifics on how to prepare invertebrate specimens vary between museums
      and vary based on the intended use of the samples. If lodging specimens
      with a museum or other institution, discuss their requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Dry-mounting may be chosen for a representative subset of specimens across
      taxa groups, in order to build up a reference collection.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Certain taxa such as moths and butterflies are best dry mounted to retain
      morphological features. If taxa are collected in preserving solution, they
      need to be washed and dried before mounting.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Dry mounting generally involves pinning, or gluing to ‘carboard points’
      for small specimens. Instructions for dry mounting of specimens can be
      found in Upton et al. (2010).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Labelling samples</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Hand written field labels can be replaced with thermal printed labels,
      with the same barcode.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Each sample vial is allocated an all-in-one label, based on the approach
      of https://www.discoverlife.org/label/. The labels combine human and
      machine-readable data, with both systems uniquely identifying the
      specimens. The required label fields are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>a globally unique and machine-readable barcode identifier</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Institution</p>
      </li>

        <p>
          Human readable identifier (i.e. ID number, with Project code, Plot ID

      Ensure samples are kept upright and cool, and transported with summary
      paperwork.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If samples are being shipped, drain off as much of the preserving solution
      from the vial as possible without samples drying out, screw the cap and
      close it firmly with parafilm tape, put it into a snap-lock bag with
      label, and send by courier mail.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For air transport of specimens, follow the special provision A180
      requirements: https://www.casa.gov.au/standard-page/special-provision-a180
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An export permit may be required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Samples need to be refilled with fresh ethanol 95% on arrival to the
      laboratory (Basset 2020).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Storing samples</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Specimens will often be stored as bulk, mixed samples (reflecting how they
      were collected in the field) until identification is required, available
      or affordable.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Inspect wet samples prior to storage - check the preserving solution and
      change with or top up if necessary, with fresh 95% ethanol or undiluted
      propylene glycol. Ensure vials are properly labelled and sealed. Ensure
      that the vial contents are fully submerged before storage.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consult with the local jurisdictional museum how the wet specimens are
      best stored, either
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>standard household freezer (i.e. -20°C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>refrigerator, or</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>cool, dark environment.</p>
        <p>
          This is critical to preserve the DNA in the samples. Improper storage
          (e.g. under constant light, heat or variable temperatures) will result
          in DNA degradation rendering samples unusable for DNA sequencing.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Specimens should be offered to the local jurisdictional museum for
      archiving, giving them the first right of refusal. The Australian Museum,
      the CSIRO Australian National Insect Collection or other institutions may
      then be consulted to identify their interest in the potential specimens.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Analysing samples</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The standardised approach to data collection enables indices of the
      relative abundance of species and change in species composition to be
      estimated within and between sites and overtime. These indices reflect the
      activity during the sampling period, and the density of the populations in
      the sampled habitat (Brown and Matthews 2016; Patrick 2016; Sherley and
      Stringer 2016).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is important to account for seasonal variation, between year variation
      and prevailing weather conditions when interpreting the results.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The inherent biases and sampling differences of the sampling methods need
      to be considered before making inferences. For example, relative abundance
      of species caught differs from their actual relative abundance in the
      habitat because species’ susceptibility to capture varies. The catch rate
      may also vary in different systems (e.g. dense vegetation may inhibit free
      movement of individuals and the visibility of traps) (Sherley and Stringer
      2016).

      The absence of invertebrates from a monitoring event can also be useful
      for analysis (Grange et al. 2021).

      Advances in DNA sequencing provide an efficient and reliable means to
      identify mass samples and measure invertebrate diversity, removing the
      need for time-consuming, manual processing (Hebert et al. 2016). Unknown
      taxa are provided with a barcode index number (BIN) until their
      identifications are known (Hobern and Adamowicz 2021).

      BIOSCAN (International barcode of life) has developed protocols and
      sequencing platforms for DNA analysis, with current analysis costs at a
      few dollars per specimen. In partnership with collaborators, the barcode
      reference library is constantly being updated. These developments lay the
      foundations for a globally consistent DNA-based biomonitoring approach
      (Hobern and Adamowicz 2021). See: https://ibol.org/programs/bioscan/.

      The exchange of genetic resources is controlled under the
      <em>Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and
        Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization
        (https://www. cbd.int/abs/). This may affect the ability of the global
        taxonomic community to provide diagnostic services (Hobern and Adamowicz
        2021).
