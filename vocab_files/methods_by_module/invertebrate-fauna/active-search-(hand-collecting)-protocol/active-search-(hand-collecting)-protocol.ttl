    dcterms:description """<p>
  This protocol involves meandering across the fauna plot for 60 minutes
  (minimum), during the day and at night, in search of invertebrates. If time is
  spent identifying or observing invertebrates during the 60 minutes of active
  surveyor time, then additional survey time should be added.
</p>
<p>
  Diurnal active search includes looking under logs, rocks and litter, under
  bark, on leaves and flowers etc. All invertebrate species directly observed
  are collected. Indirect invertebrate observations via sign (e.g. ant nests,
  webs, cocoons, casings, shells, borings, galls, burrows) can also be recorded.
  The nocturnal search involves recording any species observed, without moving
  habitat components. Observed invertebrates are collected by hand, often
  assisted by hand-held apparatus (e.g. vial, kill jar, aspirator, paint brush,
  forceps, collecting net, beating tray). A representation of the different
  invertebrate species/life-stages observed are collected, photographed and
  preserved for later identification and potential future analysis.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Turn on Trimble ® R1, open the Invertebrate fauna module from the main

    <p>
      Work across the Fauna Plot (wandering is acceptable), either alone or as a
      pair, carefully searching for invertebrates and collecting as many
      different types of invertebrates as possible. The App can be used to
      assist with navigation. Look on the ground, on and under plants (bark,
      leaves, fruit, flowers, base, roots) and in the air. Actively search for
      invertebrates by lifting rocks and logs, raking leaf-litter and top soil,
      exposing soil, peeling bark, shaking branches, opening galls and seedpods,
      breaking open rotting woody debris, opening termite mounds and excavating
      burrows. Return rocks, logs and litter back to their original position.
      Use hand-held equipment (e.g. nets, aspirator, forceps, paint brush) to
      assist collection.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select Add photo. Ideally, take a close-up representative photo of all the
      invertebrate types. This should be done while they are alive, prior to
      placing in preservatives. Use a scale card or something for scale in the
      photo if possible. Some slow-moving invertebrates can be photographed
      before collection, whereas faster moving species will need to be placed in
      an empty container first. Photos should also be taken (with scale card) of
      any obvious and intact invertebrate sign observed, such as trapdoor spider
      burrows, webs and casings. Review photo/s, ensuring they are in focus.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A Photo description can be provided for each photo (free text). Specific
      habitat information should be recorded (e.g. in leaf-litter, on X sp. of
      plant). Identification of the invertebrates is not required (as this will
      use up field time that should be spent searching, and in most cases
      identification will require expert input). If multiple photos are taken of
      the same specimen, this should be noted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      At least one individual (ideally a few) of each presumably different
      species and life-stage, should be collected. Transfer the collected
      specimens into the bulk collecting jar containing liquid preservative (95%
      ethanol or undiluted propylene glycol), or use a kill jar for specimens
      that are better dry preserved). For dry preservation instructions, see
      Section 13.

  <li>
    <p>
      Take a small thermal printed barcode label and scan using the app. Write
      the following information on the label in lead pencil (approx size 4
      font): Project number, Location, Plot ID, Date, Observer.
    </p>

      Select the Plot ID for the sample from the drop-down list (the last plot
      surveyed should appear at the top of the list).

  <li>
    <p>
      Select the Preservation type (drop-down list, e.g. 95% ethanol, undiluted
      propylene glycol, dried).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Unscrew the lid of the collecting jar/s and decant all captures into one
      jar (using a sieve or nylon mesh filter to assist). Place the barcode
      label alongside the container (not in the container). Select Add photo and
      take a photo looking down (into the sample container with the lid off),
      with the barcode visible.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select Save record.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place the small thermal barcode label into the preserving fluid in the
      sample container, top up with liquid preservative to prevent fluid
      splashing around, and screw the lid on tightly.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For additional measure, a small sticker barcode (duplicate of the code in
      the sample) is placed on the side or base of the sample container – this
      enables the sample information to be readily retrieved without having to
      open the container and remove the label from the fluid for scanning.

  <li>
    <p>
      Follow the instructions of Diurnal searching above. Note the noctural

      plot (wandering is acceptable), either alone or as a pair, carefully
      searching for invertebrates. Hold the torch/spotlight at eye level and
      scan the light across the ground, up and down trees, and across other
      habitat components. Look for spider eye shine on the ground from
      approximately 5-10 m away. Collect as many different types of
      invertebrates as possible.

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be aware of fauna traps in operation at the time of active surveys so they
      are not disturbed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Active searching should be undertaken after the other active survey
      protocols (foliage beating and sweep netting), so the results of these
      protocols are not impacted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In addition to this protocol, opportunistic observations of invertebrates
      should be recorded during the field survey, both on plot and off-plot
      (broader survey area).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be careful using bare hands for collection, as some invertebrates can
      sting, bite or secrete irritants. There are also invertebrate mimics
      (Bulbert et al. 2007).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Diurnal searching</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Diurnal active search effort must be a minimum of 60 minutes surveyor
      time. Increased effort is recommended if invertebrate trapping protocols
      are not undertaken within the plot. It is the responsibility of the
      surveyor coordinator to assess the suitability of increasing the effort.
      The effort can be increased by repeating the search on different days and
      different times of the day (i.e. morning and afternoon diurnal searches)
      under different weather and cloud cover conditions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Diurnal active searching can be conducted at any time of the day. Insect
      activity generally peaks during sunny, warm conditions (e.g. after 10 am).
      Hot and dry conditions may force surface dwelling species to find shelter
      and can be more difficult to find. Sampling during rainy or moist
      conditions can reveal different species (e.g. snails, slugs, worms,
      millipedes). Windy conditions should be avoided. If undertaking multiple
      searches over a monitoring period, select a different time of the
      day/weather conditions to maximise the potential to record different taxa.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Diurnal active searching may be conducted whilst the fauna plot is being
      trapped (i.e. you do not need to wait until the conclusion of the
      trapping). Active searches for invertebrates can follow or precede a
      vertebrate fauna active search, or be completed concurrently if there are
      multiple observers (i.e. two observers focused on vertebrate fauna, and
      two on invertebrate fauna).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure disturbance to the plot is minimised. This is especially important
      if other protocols are being undertaken at the time, and/or will be
      repeated over time. All rocks and timber, especially hollow logs, must be
      put back into place. Do not remove fauna refuges, or move them so they no
      longer provide refuge.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Destructive methods, i.e. ripping bark of trees, lifting logs etc., should
      be restricted to the outer edge of the fauna plot to limit disturbance.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Destructive methods can also be conducted off-plot, within 20 m of the
      plot boundary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Searching rare plants or uncommon landscape components (e.g. rock piles)
      may reveal conservation significant and SRE species that are not detected
      during other methods.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Nocturnal searching</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Due to WHS concerns, nocturnal searches do not involve moving habitat
      components, and should not be conducted alone.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Nocturnal search effort must be a minimum of 60 minutes surveyor time.
      Increased effort is recommended if trapping protocols (light trapping,
      micro-pitfall trapping) are not undertaken within the fauna plot. The
      effort can be increased by repeating the search on different nights
      (rather than extended the search time for one session).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ideally nocturnal searching should commence between 1 and 2 hours after
      dark, and no later. Surveyors should take care to minimise noise and
      disturbance.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where possible, schedule the nocturnal searches to avoid nights
      surrounding a full moon (all surveys should avoid a full moon where
      possible) if cloud cover is sparse.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Nocturnal searching may be conducted whilst the fauna plot is being
      trapped (i.e. you do not need to wait until the conclusion of the
      trapping) with the exception of light trapping within the plot or at a
      nearby plot (if the light from the trap is visible). If light trapping is
      being undertaken, nocturnal survey should be undertaken after (not before)
      so the results of the light trapping are not impacted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If undertaking the light trapping protocol, then don’t spend too much time
      focused on flying insects attracted to head-torches during the nocturnal
      search as these species will most likely be detected during the light
      trapping protocol.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
