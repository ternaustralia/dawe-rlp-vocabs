    dcterms:description """<p>
  Leaf litter is collected from five locations within the fauna plot. At each
  location, a 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrat is used to define the area from which the
  litter is collected. At sites where litter is scare, collection can occur over
  4 m<sup>2</sup>. The litter is coarse filtered using a litter sifter or
  reducer to remove large leaves and twigs from the sample, then the sieved
  litter is placed into a compact Berlese funnel. Leaf litter sampling is
  ideally undertaken on the first day of a monitoring event, as it can take up
  to five days for the samples to dry, or on the last day, if the samples are to
  be processed in a laboratory.

      Place the 1 m<sup>2</sup> quadrat on the ground over the leaf litter to be
      sampled. Also place a white tray or sheet on the ground next to the
      qudrat, upon which a bucket and the sifter can be placed. Using a shovel,
      hand trowel and/or hands, scoop the litter from the edge of the quadrat
      toward the centre and from the top of the litter to the bottom, into a
      20 L bucket marked in 1 L increments, until all the litter has been
      collected from inside the quadrat. If leaf-litter is scarce, collection
      can occur over 4 m<sup>2</sup>. Any debris falling outside the bucket
      should be recollected and added to the bucket.
    </p>

<ol start="22">
  <li>
    <p>
      If not using a sifter, go to Step 24. Hold the sifter over the white
      tray/sheet, so that the end of the sifter is within the bucket and
      supported by the ground. Transfer the litter from the bucket onto the
      internal mesh screen of the litter reducer/sifter, using the larger 1 cm
      mesh size in the sifter. Break open decayed wood, twigs and clods of soil
      before placing in the sifter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Shake the two handles of the sifter, so that the smaller particles fall to
      the bottom. Collect any invertebrates remaining on the mesh, using an
      aspirator, forceps or kill jar as necessary. Place the captures directly
      into the sampling container half filled with 95% ethanol or propylene
      glycol.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Temporarily place the sifted litter into a bucket. Fit the litter
      reducer/sifter with the smaller 0.5 cm mesh size internal screen (50 mm).
      Place the sifted litter on the internal mesh screen and resift. Collect
      any invertebrates remaining on the mesh as per Step 22.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      With the ground sheet or tray or a cup underneath the tip of the funnel,
      transfer the sifted leaf-litter into a Berlese funnel (one per location).
      The litter should be about 10-12 cm deep in the middle of the funnel. Any
      litter falling out onto the tray/sheet underneath or that fell through the
      mesh is scooped up and put back in the funnel. After filling, make sure
      the opening at the funnel tip is not clogged. Close the top of the funnel
      so that invertebrates can’t escape and other insects can’t get into the
      sample. Attach a 100 ml collection bottle half-filled with 95% ethanol or
      undiluted propylene glycol to the bottom of the funnel, to preserve
      insects that emerge from the litter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Write the leaf-litter sampling location ID and date on masking tape with
      permanent marker and attach to the side of the Berlese Funnel.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Hang the Berlese funnel up somewhere sheltered from rain, ideally in a dry
      ventilated area away from wind and disturbance so the litter sample can
      dry gradually – this process will take two to five days, depending on
      moisture content of the litter, the temperature and humidity. If there is
      access to electricity, a light can be used to help dry the sample. If
      using a light, check the box External heat source and provide details in
      the Comment field (e.g. wattage, distance from funnel). Suspend the light
      about 2 cm above the Berlese funnel, ensuring it is not touching the
      funnel. If electricity is not available, heat packs can be used to heat
      the sample or the funnels can be placed in the sun (note however that
      extreme radiant heat can desicate the catch before reaching the bottom of
      the funnel), Check the sample container to ensure the preservative
      solution does not dry out during extraction – refill as necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once the leaf-litter is dry, remove the collection bottle from the Berlese
      funnel. Select End Litter extraction. The Date and Time is auto-recorded,
      so there is record of how long the sample was dried for.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Sieve the preserved sample using a nylon stocking or equivalent to remove
      litter debris from the sample and store in 95% ethanol or propylene
      glycol. Screw the lid on tightily and keep the bottle upright. Ensure the
      bottle is labelled with the Plot ID, Sample location ID, Observer and
      Date.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat Steps 12 to 28 for each location.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Return the sieved leaf-litter to the location from which it was removed.
      If this is not possible, dispose of appropriately (see Guidelines).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Return to the field vehicle or an area where all the equipment is
      available.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set up the samples, labels and barcodes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Open the App, select Leaf-litter extraction protocol and select Add sample
      then Scan barcode. Take a small thermal printed barcode label and scan
      using the app. Select the Plot ID and Litter sampling location ID for the
      sample from the drop-down list. Select Save record. The barcode ID will
      now be linked to the record of the surveyed litter location. The Time and
      Date of sample collection will be auto-recorded (option to override).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the Preservation type (drop-down, default is 95% ethanol or
      undiluted propylene glycol).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Write the following information on the label in lead pencil (approx size 4
      font): Project number, Location, Plot ID, Date, Observer, Plant ID and
      plant species.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Unscrew the lid of the first sampling container. Place the barcode label
      alongside the container (not in the container). Select Add photo and take
      a photo looking down (into the sample container with the lid off), with
      the barcode visible (place a blank piece of white paper underneath the
      container for the best photo).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place the small thermal barcode label into the preserving fluid in the
      sample container, top up with liquid preservative to prevent fluid
      splashing around, and screw the lid on tightly.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For additional measure, a small sticker barcode (duplicate of the code in
      the sample) is placed on the side or base of the sample container – this
      enables the sample information to be readily retrieved without having to
      open the container and remove the label from the fluid for scanning. Note:
      only one barcode is allocated to a sample.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select Save record.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Repeat for each Berlese funnel sample (can have multiple samples per
      location, e.g. split by preservation type).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Store the collection vials in a cool location out of direct light (e.g. in
      an cooler) until they can be processed for long-term storage. Do not leave
      in hot vehicle or in sun as this degrades the sample for DNA analysis.

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure there is no disturbance to the vegetation plot, and that any
      disturbance to the fauna plot is minimised. This is especially important
      if undertaking repeat sampling. It is acceptable to undertake this
      protocol outside of the fauna plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Avoid taking litter samples near the nests of social insects (ants,
      termites), to avoid biased estimates of abundance/occurrence in samples.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat litter sampling should be offset by one metre.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Follow safety procedures for use of chemicals in the field, General survey
      guidelines.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To prevent contamination of samples for DNA analysis, a face mask and
      latex gloves should be worn when collecting samples (and gloves changed
      after handling each sample), and all equipment should be cleaned with
      brushes and bleach, rinsed with distilled water and allowed to dry between
      samples (Basset 2020).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Wearing gloves also reduces the risk of bites and stings, and masks should
      be used to prevent inhalation of litter/soil samples. Be aware of the
      potential for snakes and scorpions to be hiding in leaf-litter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Invertebrates will remain alive in a sealed bag for several days if not
      exposed to heat and if the material doesn’t dry out, which means
      extraction can be undertaken away from the field site if more appropriate.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Some invertebrates are difficult to detect or distinguish with the naked
      eye and sorting may need to be conducted using a stereo-microscope (EPA
      2016).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure the necessary permits (e.g. biosecurity, scientific) are obtained
      before transporting litter/soil off-site. Any litter/soil samples removed
      from the site must be sealed so that invertebrates are not inadvertently
      introduced elsewhere.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Before disposing of soil samples (if off-site), it is recommended the
      samples are microwaved to kill any living organisms.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ideally place the samples in the Berlese funnel immediately after sifting,
      or if not, within 5 hours of collection. If they will not be extracted
      immediately, ensure the samples are removed from intense heat; use coolers
      so the invertebrates do not desiccate, which would bias the extraction
      (Basset 2020).
    </p>
  </li>
