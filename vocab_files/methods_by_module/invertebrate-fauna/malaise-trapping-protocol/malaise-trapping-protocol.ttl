    a skos:Concept ;
    dcterms:description """<p>
  This protocol involves the use of a single Townes style malaise trap within
  the fauna plot. The malaise trap is positioned at a chosen location within the
  plot aimed at maximizing potential captures. The trap is left in-situ for five
  (minimum) to seven (recommended) consecutive nights. Once a trap is in place,
  it can be left unattended for up to seven days before the collection bottle
  needs changing (GMP 2019; D'Souza et al. 2021). Trapping can be undertaken for
  a longer consecutive period or across different seasons, to build a more
  comprehensive picture of invertebrate activity at the site. If trapping is
  undertaken as part of the GMP, the trap is left in-situ for a full year, with
  the collection bottle replaced every seven days. The protocol instructions
  incorporate the requirements of the GMP.
</p>
<p>
  Trapping is ideally timed during periods of peak insect activity (i.e., during
  warm, sunny weather). It is important that repeat sampling is undertaken at
  the same location, at the same time of year, and during similar weather
  conditions. The results represent a snapshot of the insect community present
  within the habitat type, at a particular time of year. Sampling can be
  undertaken at more than one time throughout the year (GMP 2019; D'Souza et al.
  2021).

  <li>
    <p>
      Carry the Mobile device, Trimble® R1, malaise trap and equipment to
      install the trap, to the fauna plot, avoiding walking through the
      vegetation plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select a suitable location for the malaise trap within the fauna plot.
      Ideally, the location is reasonably flat with low or no undergrowth (at
      least 2 m x 1.5 m). Avoid areas of potential wildlife or human
      disturbance/vandalism. To maximise the catch, select a probable insect
      flight path (e.g. natural corridor, ridge, gully, forest edges, clearings,
      elevated sites, gaps between bushes, semi-enclosed pathway). In flat, open
      systems where there is no obvious corridor, select any suitable location
      within the plot; in such situations, captures may be maximised by placing
      the trap on the northern side of shrubs (if any are present).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assemble and position the malaise trap:</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Assemble poles. Make sure segments are completely seated in joints.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Push ends of longer pole into pockets of taller end of malaise trap. Be
      careful not to over bend the pole.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clip hooks around pole. Take care to maintain gentle curve in pole.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat steps with shorter pole and lower end of malaise trap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Position the trap so that the vertical panels are in contact with the
      ground, the vertical panel of netting (i.e. the interception area) that
      the insects hit is oriented roughly perpendicular to the most likely
      flight path, and the head of the trap (the highest point of the trap with
      the collecting bottle) toward the end which points most toward the sun in
      the latter half of the day.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Peg the bottom edges so they are touching the ground.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Stake out guy ropes from the poles of the top of both ends of malaise trap
      to make it stand taut. Additional guy points can be used if considered
      necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Stake base of malaise trap, especially at ends of poles, so the trap is
      taut.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When possible, tie the front and/or back ropes to nearby trees for added
      support.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Also, if available, attach the trap poles to a 6- to 8-foot dropper at its
      highest points to protect the trap against falling over from high winds,
      especially if it is placed in an exposed area.

      are still in place and to monitor for and repair damage. If extreme
      weather is expected it may be necessary to remove the trap. Check the
      collection bottles. If using ethanol as the preserving fluid, evaporation
      can be an issue. If necessary, top-up the sample bottles to the 400 ml
      mark.
    </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Top up the sample containers with preserving fluid (undiluted propylene
      glycol or 95% ethanol) if necessary, to prevent fluid splashing around and
      damaging the samples in the container. Return the lid and ensure it is
      screwed on tightly. For additional measure, place a small sticker barcode
      (duplicate of the code in the sample) on the side of the sample container
      – this enables the sample information to be readily retrieved without
      having to open the container and remove the label from the fluid for
      scanning.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Store the containers in a cool location out of direct light. Do not leave
      in hot vehicle or in sun as this degrades the sample for DNA analysis.

      Ideally, place the samples in a standard household freezer (i.e. -20°C)
      for storage. Ensure that the entire insect mass is fully submerged in
      ethanol before storage; add fresh 95% ethanol or undiluted propylene
      glycol to the sample bottle as needed. If a freezer is unavailable, store
      the samples in a refrigerator or cool, dark location. This is critical to
      preserve the DNA in the samples; improper storage (e.g. under constant
      light, heat or variable temperatures) will result in DNA degradation
      rendering samples unusable for DNA sequencing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Refer to Section 13 for post-field sample preservation and processing

    <p>
      If posting samples for analysis/identification as part of the GMP, decant
      off most of the ethanol from each bottle using the decanting lid and nylon
      mesh filters provided. Thoroughly rinse the filter between samples. There
      is a 30 ml ethanol maximum per container for shipment and a maximum total
      of 1 L ethanol per package as per International Air Transport Association
      (IATA) regulations. To follow this protocol, drain the ethanol right to
      the insect mass. Make sure each bottle is tightly sealed and place them
      into a plastic bag before packaging in a box. If samples are collected for
      the GMP, dispatch samples to the Centre of Biodiversity Genomics, Guelph,
      Canada using cardboard boxes of appropriate size. Shipping 26 samples at a
      time is recommended. Refer to the GMP sampling protocol for shipping
      instructions (GMP 2019).

    <p>
      Ethanol (as the killing agent/preserving fluid) is likely to evaporate
      faster than propylene glycol, particularly in exposed sites. This can be
      compensated by attaching a larger collection container (with more fluid)
      or by the replenishing fluid during the week (Evans 2016b).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A moth excluder can be inserted into the collecting head to prevent the
      entry of large insects such as Lepidoptera or dragonflies.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In areas with high vertebrate traffic (wild animals or livestock) it may
      be necessary to place a temporary barrier (e.g. chicken wire), around the
      trap location (Whitman et al. 2019). Use of barriers/additional fixtures
      must be recorded in the comments field.

      Schmidt et al. (2019) provides a protocol for preparing Lepidoptera from
      malaise trap samples that were preserved in ethanol.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In areas frequented by people, consider placing a sign next to the trap
      stating what it is, to potentially avoid the traps being tampered with.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If there are consistent issues with wildlife disturbance or human
      vandalism, the trap can be relocated (GMP 2019). Ensure that all the
      details for this are recorded.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Damaged traps should be repaired (if possible) or replaced. Faded traps
      should also be replaced. If using traps that have been damaged/or altered
      in any way, this should be recorded in the comments data field.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Samples</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If sorting of samples is required (depending on project aims), the time
      commitment can be considerable given the large catch volumes. Sometimes
      sub-sampling is necessary (i.e., taking a known fraction of the total
      volume, ensuring that the sample is completely mixed beforehand).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Analysis</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Sorting of bulk samples is not necessary for the purpose of DNA analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Standardising data analysis is an equally important aspect of comparing
      results between sites (Hobern and Adamowicz 2021). This is beyond the
      scope of this protocol but is further discussed in Section 10.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Projects involved in the GMP send collected samples to the Centre for
      Biodiversity Genomics (Canada) for sequence analysis and DNA barcoding,
      and in return, the contributors receive a site specific summary of the
      species diversity identified for the given survey time (Centre of
      Biodiversity Genomics 2021).
