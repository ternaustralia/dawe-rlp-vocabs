<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols</h2>
<p>The Fauna Aerial Surveys Module outlines the protocol for recording
fauna observations during an aerial survey in a standardised manner. The
protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for collecting field
data directly into the Monitor app. The app records key information
including the survey personnel, the survey location and aims, when and
how the survey was conducted, the time spent searching, the equipment
used, climate conditions, track log of the transects flown, the species,
and the number of individuals observed and their distance from the
transect.</p>
<p>The module includes a desktop component that must be completed prior
to the field survey to record survey details and establish planned
transects. The module does not specify how the aerial survey should be
conducted, which allows flexibility in the design of field surveys to
best suit the project aims and target species (e.g.,, transect length,
width and alignment, aircraft type, flying height, ground speed,
equipment used).</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="general-information">General information
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>To enable repeatability of surveys and comparison of results, the
altitude and speed of the aircraft should be as constant as
possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Graduated sighting poles can be calibrated for the desired ground
distance classes when flying at the desired height above ground level
(Buckland <em>et al.</em> 1993). Calibration is undertaken using ground
markers positioned at the desired spacing of distance classes, with the
aircraft flying past these markers at the desired height above ground
level.</p></li>
<li><p>If undertaking a repeat survey, repeat the transects, timing, and
flight details of the previous survey so results can be
compared.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally, flight lines should be flown either north-south or
east-west, as this allows the pilot to follow lines of latitude or
longitude and greatly reduces the complexity of navigation (Didkowsky
2010).</p></li>
<li><p>Determining transect spacing:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>In areas of high visibility an estimate of absolute abundance may
be desired. In such cases, it is important for the transect lines to
abut, ensuring that animals observed near the edge of one line remain
visible from the next line (Didkowsky 2010).</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, an estimate of relative abundance may be desired
where each transect should be spaced according to the animal being
surveyed and the sightability conditions in the survey area, with survey
lines often spaced further apart in open habitats (Didkowsky 2010).
Spacing should also reflect the target species. For example, deer
transects may need to be spaced 1 km apart (Amos <em>et al.</em> 2014b),
though 400 m spacing is used for mule and white-tailed deer in Alberta,
Canada (Didkowsky 2010), while camel transects can be over 10 km apart
(Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2004; <a href="#appendix-2">Appendix
2</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Experienced observers:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Each observer will have their own mobile device with the Monitor
app to record fauna observations.</p></li>
<li><p>Pilots should not be involved in the field survey (Didkowsky
2010; Lethbridge et al. 2019); noting exceptions are made for open
habitats, as per Deacy et al. (2019).</p></li>
<li><p>Inexperienced observers should be limited to one per aircraft,
and they should sit on the same side of the aircraft as the most highly
experienced observer, who can provide training (Didkowsky
2010).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="weather-conditions">Weather conditions</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Weather conditions can change throughout the survey, it is
recommended that weather information is reviewed and updated (if
required) against the fauna aerial survey details at the completion of
the survey.</p></li>
<li><p>In the absence of a weather station or temperature gauge on site,
use the Bureau of Meteorology website (or other weather apps) to
estimate the temperature at the time of the survey for the closest
weather station.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="aerial-survey">Aerial survey </h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Observers should minimise communication about animal presence to
maintain the independence of surveyor observations/counts.</p></li>
<li><p>Surveys should be well planned to minimise the fatigue of the
observers, which may affect their ability to observe wildlife and/or
record accurate data (Didkowsky 2010). Similarly, workloads must be
managed to avoid undue pressure to complete a survey within a specific
timeframe. Excessive schedules lead to fatigue and impact data quality
(Didkowsky 2010).</p></li>
<li><p>Where doors have been removed from the helicopter for the survey,
ensure all items of recording equipment (e.g., mobile device, GNSS
device) are securely attached to the observer or the aircraft.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals will flee at the aircraft's approach, and it is important
that the distance sample zone should be the one in which the animal was
first sighted.</p></li>
<li><p>For double counts by two observers on the same side of the
aircraft, when analysing the data, the distance for double-counted
animals/herds/groups should be taken as that recorded by the front
observer.</p></li>

    tern:purpose """<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Fauna aerial surveys are used to obtain abundance, distribution and
time series information about populations of medium to large animals
that are visible from the air (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2022).
Consequently, they can be used to monitor management effectiveness by
determining the extent of population reduction through control
activities (Lethbridge <em>et al.</em> 2016; Saunders <em>et al.</em>
2022). Aerial surveys can rapidly cover large and inaccessible areas and
can be used across a range of systems (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2022).
Aerial counts are usually the most cost-effective and often the only
feasible method for monitoring abundance on a broad scale, especially
for species inhabiting remote areas at low densities (Lethbridge <em>et
al.</em> 2016; Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2022).</p>
<p>Developing national standardised methods for aerial surveys is
complex due to the variety of terrain and vegetation types present
(Tracey 2004; Tracey <em>et al.</em> 2005). Survey designs are also
dictated by the target species (i.e., distribution, range, activity).
Consequently, a flexible approach has been developed for the Fauna
Aerial Surveys Module, which is focused on standardising the recording
of survey data, rather than specifying how to conduct the survey.
Setting minimum data standards will ensure that aerial surveys are
undertaken transparently and that survey design and effort can be
verified, along with any observation data (Dyer and Simmonds 2021).</p>
<p>Variables associated with aerial surveys can influence results,
including observers and experience, flight height and speed, weather,
time of the day and vegetation cover (Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2022).
Consequently, documenting the methods used for aerial surveys with
sufficient levels of detail is crucial to determine the data quality and
appropriate analysis. Automated recording of survey details (flight date
and time, height, speed, and track logs) through the app ensures flight
paths are documented and facilitates flexibility in designs while
ensuring that enough information is collected to allow surveys to be
repeated. In addition, data collection through the Monitor app removes
transcription errors and facilitates data management, access and
sharing.</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
    tern:scope """<h1 id="introduction-and-background">Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>The Fauna Aerial Surveys Module outlines the procedures and
guidelines for recording the details of an aerial survey and any fauna
observed. Aerial surveys involve the detection and counting of animals
from an aircraft and are commonly used to monitor the abundance, density
and distribution of medium to large vertebrate fauna across broad areas.
Conventional aerial surveys are undertaken using aircraft during
daylight hours, with onboard observers recording direct visual counts of
animals, or groups of animals, seen within a designated area (Linklater
<em>et al.</em> 2001; Bureau of Land Management 2005; Mitchell and
Balogh 2007b).</p>
<p>Fauna aerial survey design varies between studies and the species
targeted, including the transect length, width and spacing, flight
height and ground speed, and the time and extent of search effort (e.g.,
Melville <em>et al.</em> 2008; Tracey <em>et al.</em> 2008; Gentle and
Pople 2013; Amos <em>et al.</em> 2014a; Algar <em>et al.</em> 2020;
Lethbridge <em>et al.</em> 2020; Saunders <em>et al.</em> 2022).
Consequently, the Fauna Aerial Surveys Module focuses on standardising
the recording of survey information and fauna observations rather than
providing prescriptive guidelines for how surveys should be undertaken.
Survey design should be tailored to the habitat and ecology of the
target fauna species, and recommendations are provided within the module
to assist with survey planning (<a href="#appendix-2">Appendix
2</a>).</p>
<p>This module requires specialist equipment and training, and
suitability should be assessed according to the project requirements,
study area and target species. In addition, the module must be conducted
with the appropriate approvals and permits from state/territory
jurisdictions responsible for administering scientific research on
wildlife and conducting aerial research.</p>
<p>The Fauna Aerial Surveys Module approach is based on the <em>Ranger's
