<p>
  The Pest Fauna Control Activities Module covers the procedures and guidelines
  for recording the outcomes of ground shooting, aerial shooting, baiting,
  trapping, and mustering. It can also be used for other control methods if an
  estimate of abundance or density can be obtained. The key measure recorded is
  the number of target animals removed (killed, trapped, or mustered) or bait
  taken to inform monitoring of pest fauna abundance.
</p>
<p>
  Data fields include the control method, target species, survey effort, number
  of animals removed, the activity's date and time, location, weather
  conditions, personnel involved, and details of their role and experience. Data
  is entered directly into the Monitor app on a GPS/GNSS-enabled device, and a
  location track log is recorded during the survey. Point data can be collected
  to record information, such as the location of target individuals.
</p>
<h2 id="relationships-to-other-modules">Relationships to other modules</h2>
<p>
  The Pest Fauna Control Activities Module should supplement the pest fauna
  management information collected in the Interventions Module. Ideally, the
  Pest Fauna Control Activities Module should complement the information
  obtained from monitoring-focused approaches as available in the Fauna Aerial
  Surveys Module, Camera Trapping Module, Ground Counts Module, and Sign-based
  Fauna Surveys Module. It can also be used with plot-based methods to assess
  ecological changes over time compared to baseline pre-control data.
</p>
<p>
  The Pest Fauna Control Activities Module is linked to the following modules:
</p>
<h3 id="mandatory-related-modules">Mandatory related modules</h3>
<p>
  Mandatory modules for when implementing the Pest Fauna Control Activities
  Module:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/8b334ccd-5e1a-474c-88e1-0f9b02d7d9c6">Interventions Module</a> – should be completed if the project includes planned
      pest fauna interventions within the project area. Intervention refers to
      the control action (i.e. the area where feral cats were targeted using
      trapping techniques), whilst the Pest Fauna Control Activities Module
      collects information about the number of animals removed (i.e. the number
      of cats caught and euthanised). In some situations, intervention and
      outcome data can be collected simultaneously (i.e. trap effort, location
      and types of traps used, and the trapping results).
    </p>

<p>
  Optional modules recommended to complement the Pest Fauna Control Activities
  Module:

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/6fd39a33-9c4f-469e-80a5-e76b5d5f04a6">Opportune Module</a> – enables the recording of opportunistic direct sightings
      of fauna species and indirect signs of fauna (i.e. tracks, scats etc.)
      captured in a standardised way. Opportune sightings anywhere within the
      project area whilst undertaking any survey, or non-survey activity, can be
      recorded. Data collected via the Opportune Module can assist in
      identifying if fauna species present in the project area are being missed
      through the other modules being implemented.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Fauna Ground Counts Module – can be used to obtain pre- and
      post-intervention activities monitoring data, including the distribution
      and relative abundance of pest fauna across the survey area. The Ground
      Counts Survey Module is a survey module for recording observations and is
      not to be used whilst undertaking intervention or control activities (i.e.
      spotlighting surveys at night can be undertaken as part of the Ground
      Counts Survey Module, but no shooting can occur). Use this Pest Fauna
      Control Activities Module for shooting results.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Fauna Aerial Surveys Module – can be used to obtain pre- and
      post-intervention activities monitoring data, including the distribution
      and relative abundance of pest fauna across the survey area. The Aerial
      Count Surveys Module is a survey module for recording observations. It is
      not to be used whilst undertaking intervention or control activities (i.e.
      counting the number of individuals observed from the air is undertaken as
      part of the Fauna Aerial Surveys Module, but no shooting can occur). Use
      this Pest Fauna Control Activities Module for aerial shooting results.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Sign-based Fauna Surveys Module – can establish track plots associated
      with control-based interventions, i.e. a sand pad around a cage trap or
      bait station. Use the Sign-based Fauna Surveys Module to record the sand
      plot details and the Pest Fauna Control Activities Module to record the
      results.

<p>Pest fauna control is one of the most common interventions undertaken
in Australia (Capon <em>et al.</em> 2020). It formed a critical
component of projects under the Regional Land Partnership (RLP) program.
Despite this, there is significant uncertainty around the efficacy of
pest fauna control activities (Reddiex and Forsyth 2004; Forsyth <em>et
al.</em> 2005; Garrard <em>et al.</em> 2020), with information about
on-ground works often poorly documented (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 1998;
Kanowski <em>et al.</em> 2010; Lindenmayer <em>et al.</em> 2020), and
often remaining with program staff (Martin and van Klinken 2006).
Recording the outcomes of pest fauna control, including shooting,
baiting, trapping and mustering, can provide information about pest
presence and supplement non-lethal monitoring techniques in providing
relative abundance (Brothers <em>et al.</em> 1985; Recio <em>et al.</em>
2015).</p>
<p>The number of animals removed is commonly used as a population
monitoring method in management programs (Marlow <em>et al.</em> 2000;
McIlroy <em>et al.</em> 2001), and in many instances, represents the
only monitoring undertaken (see MERIT projects; <a
href="https://fieldcapture.ala.org.au/">fieldcapture.ala.org.au</a>).
Recording the outcomes of control offers a cost-effective monitoring
option as it generally requires no or little additional effort (Ramsey
<em>et al.</em> 2018) and can easily be integrated into control programs
(Mitchell and Balogh 2007c). However, using control outcomes as the sole
monitoring technique can lead to biased estimates (Mitchell and Balogh
2007a), so the method should be combined with other monitoring focussed
approaches.</p>
<p>The Pest Fauna Control Activities Module has been developed to
capture data consistently and meet minimum data standards, which can
improve decision-making, assist with reporting and allow data to be
collated and analysed at the project and regional levels. Due to the
range of control techniques available, the module has been designed to
be flexible to allow data from various control methods to be collected
while ensuring a standardised approach to data collection. The Pest
Fauna Control Activities Module has been designed to complement the
information collected in the Interventions Module, which is focused on
recording the type and extent of control undertaken.</p>

    <h1 id="introduction-and-background">Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>The Pest Fauna Control Activities Module enables the standardised
collection of the results of pest fauna removal activities. The module
records the results of activities such as shooting, baiting, trapping
and mustering. It provides data to indicate pest fauna abundance and the
number and location of pest animals removed or baits taken. This module
does not provide methods or guidelines for controlling pest fauna. The
module should be used in conjunction with the Interventions Module,
which captures the control activity details.</p>
<p>Pest fauna control activities require specialist skills, equipment,
training and licenses. These requirements must be factored into
determining the suitability of control activities for an NRM project.
The appropriateness of the control activities must be determined
according to project requirements, the project area, and the target
species. This module must be conducted in accordance with legislative
requirements and with the appropriate approvals, licenses and permits
from state/territory jurisdictions (e.g. scientific research, ethics,
aerial research, firearms, poisons). Releasing pest animals is often
prohibited, and the destruction of pest animals must be conducted
humanely, as governed by state/territory legislation and model codes of
practice.</p>
<p>A monitoring program should be established before any control
activities are undertaken, as this allows changes over time, and the
effectiveness of the control, to be assessed against baseline measures
(Mitchell and Balogh 2007c; Mitchell 2010). It is recommended that pest
fauna are monitored by using at least one EMSA module, either Aerial
Fauna Surveys, Fauna Ground Count Surveys, or Sign-based Fauna Surveys.
In addition, ecological changes in response to the control should be
monitored using the plot-based ecological monitoring modules, including
Vertebrate Fauna for the response of birds and small and medium mammals
