<p>
  This module covers the procedures and guidelines for recording interventions
  as area (polygon) datasets, along with associated data, including photos of
  on-ground works, spatial extent and details of the nature of the intervention.
  Multiple polygons can be collected for the same project, depending on the
  number and distribution of on-ground works, and these datasets can all be
  linked at the project or site level. Collection of spatial data aligns with
  the Australian Government on-ground investment location data capture
  guidelines (Commonwealth of Australia 2018) and intervention types (project
  service) and associated schema have been adapted from the MERIT Ready Reckoner
  V3 (National Landcare Program 2020). Data can only be collected for project
  service types that have a field component, such as controlling pest animals
  and erosion control. A table of intervention types, consistent with the Ready
  Reckoner, is provided as sub modules.
</p>
<p>
  Ideally, the interventions module should be used in combination with a range
  of other modules to assess ecological changes over time compared to baseline
  pre-intervention data, including

      Intervention’s data can be collected using a combination of the app while

      fields.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Information about the location and extent of the intervention, as well as
      photos need to be collected in the field. All other data fields can be
      completed or edited on return to the office. The intervention can only be
      saved when all necessary on-ground data fields have been entered while on
      site, and can only be uploaded to the database when all required fields
      have been entered.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If data fields are completed in the office, do this as soon as possible
      after the intervention was undertaken to ensure that all information is
      retained.

  <li>
    <p>
      If any changes to planned intervention activities occurred while on site,
      ensure that this information is collected in the

      Collect vertices in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. All
      vertices need to be collected in order to ensure that the area is drawn

      polygon has been completed.

      If necessary, vertices can be added, deleted or moved once the area has

      Minimum mapping scales for different kinds of on-ground actions are
      detailed in sub modules and these align with the recommendation developed

      (Commonwealth of Australia 2018).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Broader ranging actions should generally be mapped at broader scales, the
      intent should also be to create polygons which encompass all action areas
      while excluding areas where the action was not applied (Commonwealth of
      Australia 2018).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a specific intervention is not listed, one should be selected which
      most closely approximates it (Commonwealth of Australia 2018).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Fencing activities should be mapped as the fence itself. Create a polygon
      ~10 m wide that overlaps the fence line. Widths can be larger than 10 m at
      large scales.

    <h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>
  The need to better capture, store, interpret and effectively use data
  associated with on-ground interventions is widely recognised, as this can help
  to inform and prioritise future investment, generate knowledge, test
  assumptions and contribute to best practice natural resource management (Atyeo
  and Thackway 2009; Capon <em>et al.</em> 2020; DPIE 2020; Mitchell and Balogh
  2007). The collection of consistent data on interventions can improve
  decision-making, assist with reporting and allow data to be collated and
  analysed at the regional or national level (Atyeo and Thackway 2009).
  Following standardized protocols will ensure that data are precise and
  comparable, and will enable planners and policymakers to better evaluate the
  effectiveness of intervention activities and assist with setting priorities in
  terms of when and where to invest (Atyeo and Thackway 2009; Capon
  <em>et al.</em> 2020). This is likely to become increasingly more important as
  funding bodies look for evidence that their investments are producing results
  (Kanowski <em>et al.</em> 2010).
</p>
<p>
  Fine-scale polygons are key to precise and accurate spatial documentation of
  on-ground investments (Commonwealth of Australia 2018), and as such, polygons
  will be used to collect on-ground data about the size and extent of
  interventions. These polygons will be supported by additional data collection
  fields, allowing standardised data about the intervention to be recorded,
  along with photos to document what was undertaken. This information is crucial
  for reporting under the MERI framework and to align with the monitoring,
  evaluation, reporting and improvement tool (MERIT).

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>
  The <em>Interventions</em> module will allow service providers to collect
  information about interventions in a standardized way, including on-ground
  location and site evidence (photos, spatial extent) of the intervention as
  well as more detailed information about the nature of the intervention and how
  it was undertaken.
</p>
<p>
  Under the MERI (monitoring, evaluation, reporting and improvement) framework a
  project is defined as an intervention when it consists of a set of planned
  activities designed to achieve a set of objectives within a given budget and
  timeframe (Commonwealth of Australia 2009). Interventions can take a range of
  forms, including fencing to protect remnant vegetation (Spooner
  <em>et al.</em> 2002), weed and pest animal control (Martin and van Klinken
  2006; Reddiex <em>et al.</em> 2006), restoration and revegetation,
  re-introductions or translocations (Silcock <em>et al.</em> 2019), removal of
  watering points, controlled burns, nest box installation and community or
  landholder workshops (Capon <em>et al.</em> 2020). Ideally, a monitoring
  program should be established before any on-ground works are undertaken, as
  this allows changes over time to be assessed against baseline measures (Atyeo
  and Thackway 2009), and the effectiveness of the intervention to be assessed.
</p>
<p>
  The most common interventions undertaken across Australia, based on the
  current Regional Lands Partnership (RLP) projects are weed and pest fauna
  control, habitat improvement/regeneration, community/landholder engagement,
  communication, education and awareness raising, and improved land management
  (Capon <em>et al.</em> 2020). However, information about on-ground works is
  often poorly documented and monitored (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 1998; Kanowski
  <em>et al.</em> 2010; Lindenmayer <em>et al.</em> 2020), and most knowledge
  may remain with program staff (Martin and van Klinken 2006).
