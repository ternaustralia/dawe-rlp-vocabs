      Record the species name or field name if the species ID is unknown (only

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p style="color: orange">Growth stage and life-stage</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The growth and life-stage protocol is used to collect basic plot level
      summary data about the system. During this step, seedlings and saplings
      should be identified to species level where possible.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Data needs to be collected for all tree and shrub species identified
      during the <em>Floristics</em> protocol. The species list available at
      this stage, will be filtered, so only the relevant species are available
      for data collection. Data needs to be collected for all species on this
      list.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The growth stage and life-stage component of the protocol allows data to
      be collected for all perennial species present, rather than only those
      that occur within the belt transects.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Subdividing the plot and searching smaller areas systematically can help
      to ensure that recruits are not missed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Species can have multiple growth and life-stages. Ensure that all stages
      present are selected from the drop-down list. Additional growth and
      life-stages can be added to species as you move around the plot, if
      additional stages are observed (species data can be easily edited to add
      additional stages to the growth and life-stages).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A summary page is available which shows all the data collected for each
      species at the plot level. Growth and life-stage data can be easily edited
      on this page using the add button. Ensure that all growth and life-stages
      that are observed for each species have been check on the drop-down list.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Growth and life-stage should be recorded at the start of the survey so the
      observer is familiar with the species present and which species are
      recruiting before undertaking the seedling and sapling counts and small
      tree survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Growth and life-stage data can be collected at the same time as
      floristics, but species ID will need to be added to the floristics module
      before any life stage data can be assigned.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Adequate recruitment is also recorded for each perennial species present.
      As you traverse the plot, take note of the number of cohorts present for
      tree species, or the ratio of juveniles to adults for mid-storey species,
      to determine if adequate recruitment is present. The adequate recruitment
      field can be updated as you move across the plot or at the end of this
      component of the survey.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Seedling and sapling counts</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Walk along the transect and record any seedlings or saplings observed on
      either side of the tape, but within the width of the staff/pole. As you
      walk along the transect, ensure that the half-way (1 m) mark on the pole
      remains directly above the tape. The survey area should remain constant at
      1 m on either side of the tape for the entire length of the transect (see
      Appendix).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The pole can be placed on the ground, ensuring that the half-way mark is
      on the tape, to check if seedlings or saplings near the survey edge fall
      within the survey zone.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The number of seedlings and saplings should be counted on a per species
      basis. If a seedling cannot be identified to species level, efforts should
      be made to identify to genus level. If this is not possible, record as a
      generic tree or shrub seedling or sapling.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Species must be added into the <em>Floristics</em> module before any
      seedling or sapling counts can be recorded against those species.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Seedling and sapling information can only be added against the species or
      genus (or field ID) assigned during the <em>Floristics</em> module. New
      species cannot be added during this module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is recommended that the seedling and sapling counts can be undertaken
      after the point-intercept survey, as the belt transects align with the
      transects established for the <em>Cover</em> module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Count data is added using a tally format, so new individuals can be added
      and a total generated as you move along the transect. The app will
      continue to tally the number of seedlings or saplings until the transect
      has been completed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check the seedling and sapling counts at the end of each transect by
      viewing the summary page to ensure counts are correct. If in doubt for any
      species, traverse the transect again and double check numbers.
    </p>

<p style="color: orange">Small tree survey</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      As you walk along the transect, ensure that the half-way (1 m) mark on the
      pole remains directly above the tape. The survey area should remain
      constant at 1 m on either side of the tape for the entire length of the
      transect (see Appendix).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If required, subdivide the belt transect into smaller areas or mark stems
      once they have been counted (i.e., with non-permanent chalk paint) to
      ensure that individuals are not missed or recorded multiple times.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If there are several small trees within the belt transect or are high
      density areas, mark with marking paint (or flagging tape or survey pegs)
      to avoid measuring each individual more than once.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This method works best when conducted with two surveyors, one using the
      staff and taking tree measures and the second entering data into the app.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Stand as close as possible to the trunk of the small tree when recording
      the location and ensure that the Trimble R1 is active and accuracy is
      appropriate (i.e. sub-metre). See the following section for more details
      about using the R1.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It can take up to 15 minutes for the R1 to obtain a high accuracy. Ensure
      that it is activated at the start of the survey and has a high accuracy
      before any small tree location data is recorded.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The 2 m survey pole can be used to determine which individuals are classed
      as small trees (&gt;2 m tall, &lt;10 cm DBH) and can help to estimate tree
      height.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where required, tree height can be estimated using a forestry rangefinder
      for rapid and accurate height measurements. The person entering the data
      into the App can carry the rangefinder on a lanyard over their shoulder
      and record tree height when required.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where a rangefinder is not available, tree height can be estimated using
      the following methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Clinometer and tape (Department of Environment and Climate Change
          2007)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mobile phone applications.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Only tree species recorded during the floristics module will be available
      on the species list for this survey.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Using the R1</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Switch on the R1 by depressing the power button in the centre. It will
      flash green and blue as it looks to connect to Bluetooth.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the table settings &gt; Connections &gt; turn Bluetooth ON</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select it and you should be connected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Go to the GNSS Status App and select ‘Source’. Select ‘Position Source’ to
      Bluetooth and select from available devices. Allow some time to let the
      accuracy drop to sub-metre (can take up to 10-15 minutes).
