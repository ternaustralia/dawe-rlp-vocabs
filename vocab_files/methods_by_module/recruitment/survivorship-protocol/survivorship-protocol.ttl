<h2 id="field-collection-1">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites-1">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>There are no pre-requisites for completing this protocol.</p>
<h3 id="time-requirements-1">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey activity time estimates will vary depending on plot size
chosen, the number of individuals of the target species in the project
area, the aims of the project (e.g. recording all seedlings or recording
only a particular species), and the level of difficulty in traversing
the plot.</p>
<p>As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1 - 2 hours for survey planning</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20 - 40 minutes for plot set-up and laying tape-measures
(assuming the plot has been previously set-up using the Plot Selection
and Layout Module).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 5 – 10 minutes for each individual plant tagged.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 30 minutes – 3 hours to tag all individuals.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-1">Personnel requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Searching the plot, tagging, and recording growth stage, life
stage and health information for all target species present is best
conducted with two personnel. This enables more ground, including
microhabitats, to be covered, from multiple viewpoints.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyors making the observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying the characteristic identifiable features of
target species and how to distinguish one species from another. If
surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising,
using field reference guides, and seeking advice before conducting this
protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Personnel should be familiar with and experienced in identifying
growth stages and life stages of relevant plant species.</p></li>
<li><p>Personnel should be familiar with and experienced in identifying
the characteristic features of plant health, including but not limited
to insect damage, human-induced damage and the presence of
mistletoe.</p></li>
<li><p>The Survivorship protocol involved the physical tagging of
vegetation. Therefore, scientific permits may be required, but always
check with your local authority.</p></li>
<li><p>Recruitment surveys do not involve interference with wildlife.
Therefore, wildlife ethics approvals are unlikely to be required but
always check with your local authority. Access permissions are
required.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>The Recruitment protocol is designed to be flexible with the user
determining the survey area and target species. It can be tailored to
the needs of the project and individuals can be tracked for a single
species, a group of species or all perennial species present.</p></li>
<li><p>If a population of plants is being tagged and tracked, population
extent does not need to align with the plot boundary. The boundary will
be determined by the points of the individuals on the edge of the
population.</p></li>
<li><p>Belt transects and plots may be more effective than population
extents for general tracking studies, such as following restoration or
post-fire recovery, or to compare survival and growth under different
land management activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Population extents may be more effective for targeted studies,
such as translocations, threatened species monitoring, targeted
tubestock planting and woody weed control.</p></li>
<li><p>Users define the number of species that will be recorded at the
start of the survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Individuals should be tagged systematically to ensure that plants
are not missed and to assist with any subsequent re-surveys.</p></li>
<li><p>The position of each individual only needs to be recorded during
the first survey. All the information will be available for any revisits
and will be displayed using the mapping interface, which can help
navigate around the project area and ensure all individuals are
re-surveyed.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure labels are unique. The app will create an error message if
the same ID code is used more than once.</p></li>
<li><p>See the Condition Module for more information on how to assess
plant health.</p></li>
<li><p>Record plant height in metres using a small tape measure for
younger individuals or hypsometer or rangefinder for taller
individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Flagging tape, survey markers, survey pegs, marking paint are
optional, but can help define and stratify sampling area.</p></li>
