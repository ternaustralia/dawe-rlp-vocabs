<h2 id="field-collection">Field Collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plot must be established using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Layout and Selection
Module</a> prior to conducting the Age structure protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics Module</a> must be completed prior to completing the
Age structure protocol.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey activity time estimates will vary depending on plot size, the
number of perennial species within the project area, the occurrence of a
mass recruitment event, and the level of difficulty in traversing the
plot.</p>
<p>As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1-2 hours for survey planning</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20 - 40 minutes for plot set-up and laying tape-measures
(assuming the plot has been previously set-up using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Layout and Selection Module</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 30 – 60 minutes to complete the growth and life-stage
survey</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 30 minutes to 3 hours to complete the seedling, sapling and
juvenile counts.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements">Personnel requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Searching the plot and recording growth stage, life stage and
recruitment information for all flora species present is best conducted
with two personnel. This enables more ground, including microhabitats,
to be covered, from multiple viewpoints.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyors making the observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying the characteristic identifiable features of
flora species and how to distinguish one species from another. If
surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising,
using field reference guides, and seeking advice before conducting this
protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Personnel should be familiar with and experienced in identifying
growth stages and the life stages of relevant plant species.</p></li>
<li><p>The Age structure protocol may involve the collection of plant
specimen vouchers. Therefore, scientific permits are likely to be
required, particularly for collecting threatened flora species, but
always check with your local authority.</p></li>
<li><p>Recruitment surveys do not involve interference with wildlife.
Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are unlikely
to be required but always check with your local authority. Access
permissions are required.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Subdividing the plot and searching smaller areas systematically
is recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Species can be present in multiple growth and life-stages. Ensure
that all stages present for each perennial species are
recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>Growth and life-stage should be recorded at the start of the
survey so the observer is familiar with the species present and which
species are recruiting before undertaking the seedling and sapling and
juvenile counts.</p></li>

juvenile counts</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Partitioning the sub-plot into more manageable units using the
point-intercept transect tapes set-up during the Cover Module is
recommended. Additional tapes and/or coloured survey pins is recommended
for dense systems. At least 4 x 100 m tapes are recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of seedlings, saplings and juveniles should be counted
on a per species basis. If a seedling cannot be identified to species
level, efforts should be made to identify to genus level. If this is not
possible, record as a generic tree or shrub.</p></li>
<li><p>Seedling, sapling and juvenile classes can only be added against
the species or genus (or field ID) assigned during the Floristics
Module. New species cannot be added during this module.</p></li>
<li><p>Count data is added using a tally format, so new individuals can
be added and a total generated as you move through the sub-plot. The app
will continue to tally the number of seedlings, saplings or juveniles
until the survey has been completed.</p></li>

fire or flood), only record the dominant species or target species that
are relevant to your project.</p></li>
