<p style="color: orange">Field collection</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      This protocol is designed to be flexible with the user determining the
      area to survey and the species targeted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Study area type is tailored to the project aims and is defined by the
      user. The study can involve survey of an entire population or sampling
      using belt-transects or plots.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a population of plants is being tagged and tracked, population extent
      does not need to align to the plot boundary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Belt transects and plots may be more effective for general tracking
      studies, such as following restoration or post-fire recovery, or to
      compare survival and growth under different land management activities.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Population areas may be more effective for targeted studies, such as
      translocations, threatened species monitoring, targeted tubestock planting
      and woody weed control.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Users define the number of species that will be recorded. Define the
      species list at the start of the survey. The species list provided on the
      data collection page will include the species (or genus) defined at the
      start of the project. Return to the first page to add additional species,
      if required.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Individuals should be tagged systematically to ensure that plants are not
      missed and to assist with any subsequent re-surveys.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Life-stage and health information aligns with the information collected
      for the <em>Condition</em> module. More information about each are
      available in the supporting information or by referring to the
      <em>Condition</em> module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The position of every individual is recorded, so it is important that the
      R1 is active and has high accuracy. Allow up to 15 minutes for suitable
      accuracy to be obtained. Refer to the section below for more details about
      using the R1.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The position of each individual only needs to be recorded during the first
      survey. All the information will be available for any repeat visits and
      will be displayed using the mapping interface, which can help navigate
      around the project area and ensure all individuals are re-surveyed.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Using the R1</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Switch on the R1 by depressing the power button in the centre. It will
      flash green and blue as it looks to connect to Bluetooth.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the table settings &gt; Connections &gt; turn Bluetooth ON</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select it and you should be connected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Go to the GNSS Status App and select ‘Source’. Select ‘Position Source’ to
      Bluetooth and select from available devices. Allow some time to let the
      accuracy drop to sub-metre (can take up to 10-15 minutes).
