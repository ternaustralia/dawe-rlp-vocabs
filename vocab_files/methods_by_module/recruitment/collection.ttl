<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols </h2>
<p>The Recruitment Module covers the procedures and guidelines of two
protocols for recording age class structure and survivorship of
vegetation within a core monitoring plot. Depending on the project aims
and the system under study, recruitment surveys can consist of a single
protocol or combination of the two protocols. The two protocols are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c93922b2-3b0e-4ee1-b1ef-c9719d039f5f">Age Class Protocol</a> – consists of two sub-protocols, the growth
stage and life-stage surveys at the plot level (100 x 100 m), and
seedling, sapling and juvenile counts at the subplot level (40 x 40 m).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f470e27d-20ed-46dc-b64a-d67b39a9dffc">Survivorship Protocol</a> – enables users to tag individual plants
with a unique ID, record location, health, growth stage and life-stage, and record size measurements for individual plants.</p></li>

Cover Module can be used to mark the border of the 40 x 40 m subplot for
the seedling, sapling and juvenile counts.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/8b334ccd-5e1a-474c-88e1-0f9b02d7d9c6">Interventions Module</a> – if recruitment is being assessed before
and after an intervention (e.g. revegetation, translocation), it is
recommended that the Interventions Module also be completed.</p></li>

height (DBH) measures undertaken as part of the Tree survey protocol in
the Condition Module or within the Basal Area Module can be used in

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Recruitment is an indicator of ecosystem health as it shows processes
such as pollination are occurring, soil conditions are suitable for
vulnerable juvenile plants and grazing pressure is within acceptable
limits (DEC 2012). The on-going absence of seedlings and/or juvenile
plants can be a sign that ecosystem processes have been disrupted,
particularly if climatic conditions have been favourable for
germination, and this can limit the long-term survival of species in the
landscape (Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009). Land management practices, such
as burning or grazing, and natural phenomenon such as drought, can
affect the processes required for regeneration and recruitment (Fischer
<em>et al.</em> 2009; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Consequently,
understanding how landscape changes and management activities affect
population processes is critical for developing conservation strategies
and successfully managing natural resources (Broadhurst and Young
2006).</p>
<p>Growth stage and life-stage are recorded across the plot to provide
an overview of recruitment and age class structure (e.g. recruiting,
mature, senescent), and potential to recruit (presence of reproductive
material) for all perennial species present (as identified in the
Floristics Module). Multiple growth and life-stages can be recorded for
each species but a count of the number of individuals within each stage
is not required. Adequate recruitment for each perennial species is also
determined, the concept is based on the Habitat Hectares approach from
Victoria (DSE 2004) and the TASVEG guidelines (Michaels 2006).</p>
<p>Seedling, sapling and juvenile counts are undertaken to estimate the
number of recruits for tree and shrub species present, with counts
undertaken on a per species basis where possible (DOC 2019). Seedlings,
saplings and juvenile individuals can be difficult to identify, so in
instances where further identification is not possible, recording to
genus level or as a generic tree or shrub is acceptable. Due to the
small size of new recruits, area based sampling methods are more
appropriate than transects, with larger sampling areas providing a more
representative sample (DEC 2012). Consequently, a 40 x 40 m subplot
situated within the centre of a 100 x 100 m plot has been adopted as
this also enables compatibility with other related modules (e.g. Basal
Area Module and Condition Module).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
    tern:scope """
   <h1 id="introduction-and-background">Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>Fire severity is defined as the degree of consumption and scorching
of live vegetation and dead fuel, and the degree to which soil
properties and processes are altered due to combustion (Smith <em>et
al.</em> 2005; Hammill and Bradstock 2006). The Fire Severity Module
involves the collection of quantitative, accurate and repeatable
measures of fire severity using the point-intercept method (described in
detail in the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover Module</a>), as well as measurements of trunk char
height. Given that the Fire Severity Module and the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover Module</a> utilise
the same point-intercept transects, the two modules are undertaken
concurrently and this is reflected in the Monitor app.</p>
<p>The effects of fire severity are directly measured, allowing them to
be integrated into fire severity indices designed for objective fire
severity monitoring and mapping (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2013; Morgan
<em>et al.</em> 2014). This includes the calibration and validation of
broad-scale remote sensing derived fire severity indices (Hammill and
Bradstock 2006) and in calculations to determine fire intensity (Whight
and Bradstock 1999; Chafer <em>et al.</em> 2004).</p>
<p>Fire severity is quantified horizontally and vertically within the plot through the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cover and height of vegetation</p></li>
<li><p>Cover and height of charred and scorched vegetation</p></li>
<li><p>Cover and height of resprouting vegetation</p></li>
<li><p>Cover of litter and coarse woody debris (CWD)</p></li>
<li><p>Cover of charred litter and CWD</p></li>
<li><p>Cover of scorched litter (i.e. scorched leaf fall)</p></li>
<li><p>Cover of bare and charred soil</p></li>
<li><p>Cover of white and black ash</p></li>
<li><p>Trunk char height (in wooded systems).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The cover measurements are indicative of fire extent and patchiness
(Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2013). The height measurements provide insight
into the degree of charring and scorching of the vegetation in each
stratum, which are key indicators of fire severity (Whight and Bradstock
1999; Hammill and Bradstock 2006; Russell-Smith and Edwards 2006; Chafer
2008; Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2013; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>Time since fire is recorded based on on-ground knowledge and/or
available datasets (e.g. interactive online natural resources GIS
datasets) to ensure the correct interpretation and comparison of the
data.</p>
<p>The Fire Severity Module is tailored to monitor fire severity in
burnt areas, including areas subject to controlled burns. It does not
include the collection of fuel load and ecosystem response data.
However, fuel load and arrangement can be monitored with data collected
in the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover Module</a>, <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/16a20c3f-e95d-4919-b2d1-a25c7a275109">Condition Module</a> and <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/0d8b47b4-1ca8-4c76-8329-0eb781a823a2">Coarse Woody Debris Module</a>,
including the cover and depth of litter, and the cover and percentage of
dead material in the ground and mid strata. While ecosystem responses to
fire can be monitored with data collected from multiple modules (e.g.
Floristics, Cover, Vertebrate Fauna, Invertebrate Fauna, Condition,
Recruitment).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
