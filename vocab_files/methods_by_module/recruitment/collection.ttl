<h2 id="available-protocols">Available Protocols </h2>
<p>The Recruitment Module covers the procedures and guidelines of two
protocols for recording age class structure and survivorship of
vegetation within a core monitoring plot. Depending on the project aims
and the system under study, recruitment surveys can consist of a single
protocol or combination of the two protocols. The two protocols are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c93922b2-3b0e-4ee1-b1ef-c9719d039f5f">Age Class Protocol</a> – consists of two sub-protocols, the growth
stage and life-stage surveys at the plot level (100 m x 100 m) and
seedling, sapling and juvenile counts at the sub-plot level (40 x 40
m).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f470e27d-20ed-46dc-b64a-d67b39a9dffc">Survivorship Protocol</a> – enables users to tag individual plants
with a unique ID, record location, health, growth stage and life-stage,
and record size measurements for individual plants.</p></li>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Recruitment is an indicator of ecosystem health as it shows processes
such as pollination are occurring, soil conditions are suitable for
vulnerable juvenile plants and grazing pressure is within acceptable
limits (DEC 2012). The on-going absence of seedlings and/or juvenile
plants can be a sign that ecosystem processes have been disrupted,
particularly if climatic conditions have been favourable for
germination, and this can limit the long-term survival of species in the
landscape (Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009). Land management practices, such
as burning or grazing, and natural phenomenon such as drought, can
affect the processes required for regeneration and recruitment (Fischer
<em>et al.</em> 2009; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Consequently,
understanding how landscape changes and management activities affect
population processes is critical for developing conservation strategies
and successfully managing natural resources (Broadhurst and Young
2006).</p>
<p>Growth stage and life-stage are recorded across the plot to provide
an overview of recruitment and age class structure (e.g. recruiting,
mature, senescent), and potential to recruit (presence of reproductive
material) for all perennial species present (as identified in the
Floristics Module). Multiple growth and life-stages can be recorded for
each species but a count of the number of individuals within each stage
is not required. Adequate recruitment for each perennial species is also
determined, the concept is based on the Habitat Hectares approach from
Victoria (DSE 2004) and the TASVEG guidelines (Michaels 2006).</p>
<p>Seedling, sapling and juvenile counts are undertaken to estimate the
number of recruits for tree and shrub species present, with counts
undertaken on a per species basis where possible (DOC 2019). Seedlings,
saplings and juvenile individuals can be difficult to identify, so in
instances where further identification is not possible, recording to
genus level or as a generic tree or shrub is acceptable. Due to the
small size of new recruits, area based sampling methods are more
appropriate than transects, with larger sampling areas providing a more
representative sample (DEC 2012). Consequently, a 40 x 40 m subplot
situated within the centre of a 100 x 100 m plot has been adopted as
this also enables compatibility with other related modules (e.g. Basal
Area Module and Condition Module).</p>
"""^^rdf:HTML ;
    tern:scope """
   <h1 id="introduction">Introduction and background</h1>
<p>Recruitment is critical to the development, succession, and
maintenance of plant populations (Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009; Bailey
<em>et al.</em> 2012). Species need to be able to successfully produce
new generations of individuals if they are to persist over the long term
(DEC 2012). For recruitment to occur, there needs to be a sufficient
seed supply and following this, suitable conditions (water, light,
temperature and nutrients) to trigger germination and support the
establishment and development of seedlings (Bailey <em>et al.</em>
2012). Optimal conditions differ between species (Casson <em>et al.</em>
2009) and as a result, the recruitment of many tree and shrub species
can be infrequent and episodic (Michaels 2006).</p>
<p>The Recruitment Module enables users to collect a range of
information including growth and life-stages of each perennial species
present (to assess level of recruitment and potential to recruit), and
seedling, sapling and juvenile counts for woody species to assess age
class structure. A survivorship option is also available to track
survival, growth, health and life-stages of individual plants over time.
The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f470e27d-20ed-46dc-b64a-d67b39a9dffc">Survivorship Protocol</a>  is optional but it has a range of
applications, including monitoring restoration and translocation
activities, and post-fire recovery. The survivorship protocol is
optional and flexible, with the survey area and target species
determined by the user, depending on the project aims. The location of
individual plants will be recorded, and each individual will be tagged,
allowing repeat measures of health and growth to be undertaken over
time. Individuals can be tagged and tracked using belt transects, a core
plot (100 x 100 m), a subplot (40 x 40 m) or a population extent. The
survivorship protocol allows users to track selected individuals, a
single target species, multiple target species or all species
present.</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
