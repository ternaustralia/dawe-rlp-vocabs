<h2 id="available-protocols">Available Protocols</h2>
<p>This module outlines the protocol for recording fire severity within
the plot. The protocol involves recording the cover and height of fire
severity attributes from the ground to the canopy at 404
point-intercepts along four 100 m transects within the plot as well as
trunk char height at four locations within the plot.</p>
<p>The protocol includes the instructions and procedures for: setting up
four 100 m transects (2 x N/S and 2 x E/W; see <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>); recording
point-intercept fire severity data at 1 m intervals along the four
transects (for a total of 404 point-intercepts); recording trunk char
height from the four locations where the four transects intersect; and
entering the data directly into the Monitor app.</p>
<p>The guidelines provide further information regarding: workflow
efficiency; the rules for determining a 'hit’; using a densitometer to
view canopy intercepts; when to apply <em>in canopy sky</em> (ICS); and
taking trunk char height measurements.</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="estimating-vegetation-tree-char-and-scorch-height">Estimating
vegetation, tree, char and scorch height</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Heights significantly above the height of the staff should be
estimated using a forestry rangefinder for rapid and accurate height
measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>When using a rangefinder, the distance and the angle to the top
of the tree are measured at the same time, and then the distance angle
to the base of the tree are measured at the same time. The internal
calculator will then calculate the height. Ensure you are far enough
from the tree, at least the distance of the height of the tree, and can
see the top and base of the tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Where a rangefinder is not available, tree height can be
estimated using the following methods:</p></li>
<li><p>Clinometer and tape</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile phone applications</p></li>
<li><p>When using a clinometer, find a place to stand where you can see
the top of the tree. Your distance from the tree should at least be
equal to the height of the tree. Measure the distance between yourself
and the tree and measure the height from your eye to the ground. Look
through the clinometer with one eye and at the tree with the other eye.
Line up the crosshair in the clinometer with the top of the tree. Read
the value on the percent scale. This gives you the tree's height as a
percentage of the distance from the tree (e.g. a reading of 50% means
the height of the tree is half the distance you are from the
tree).</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Calculate the height of the tree using the equation:</p>
<p><em>Tree height = clinometer reading / 100 x distance to tree + eye
height</em></p></li>
<li><p>On sloping ground, two readings will need to be taken (treetop
(reading 1) and tree base (reading 2)). When the surveyor is above the
level of the tree base, the two percent values are added. Calculate the
height of the tree using the equation:</p>
<p><em>Tree height = (clinometer reading 1 + clinometer reading 2) / 100
x distance to tree</em></p></li>
<li><p>When the surveyor is below the level of the tree base, the tree
base percent is subtracted from the treetop percent. Calculate the
height of the tree using the following equation:</p>
<p><em>Tree height = (clinometer reading 1 - clinometer reading 2) / 100
x distance to tree</em></p></li>
<li><p>See <a href="#appendix-4">Appendix 4</a> for diagrams for using a clinometer in
each situation.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>There are several mobile phone applications that provide an
estimate of tree height. Like the clinometer guidelines above, a
measurement of the distance to the tree is required to estimate the
height.</p></li>

If so, then go back into the Monitor app and edit the fire ignition date

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ensure the Plot Selection and Layout Module has been completed to
mark out the plot boundary and define the current plot and visit in the
Monitor App.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the Floristics Module has been completed to ensure species
data are recorded using naming consistent with the flora species
identifications/assigned field names and growth forms recorded in the
Floristics Module.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure you are familiar with the instructions and procedures and
guidelines outlined in the Cover Module.</p></li>
<li><p>Lay out the N2/S2, N4/S4, E2/W2 and E4/W4 transects (<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>).
For each transect, lay out a 100 m tape measure using a tent peg to
secure the end in place. Ensure the tape is orientated to align with the
plot grid, is as straight as possible, and is laid on the ground and not
draped over shrubs wherever possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Move to the 0 m mark of the first transect you wish to complete.
It does not matter which order, or which direction each transect is
completed, as your start position will be recorded in Step 10.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Monitor app, select the Cover Module and then the relevant
protocol (<em>Standard</em> or <em>Enhanced</em>), depending on which
protocol you are required to undertake for your project.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the box to record the plot as <em>burnt</em>. This will
reveal the fire severity data fields in the Cover Module. If you are
undertaking the Enhanced Cover protocol, the fire severity data fields
will only be accessible when completing the N2/S2, N4/S4, E2/W2 and
E4/W4 transects, and the following steps relate only to those
transects.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the fire ignition date so the time since fire can be
calculated. This date may be based on on-ground knowledge and/or
available datasets (e.g. interactive online natural resources GIS
datasets).</p></li>
<li><p>If the date is an estimate, check the <em>ignition date is
estimate</em> box and select the <em>date accuracy</em> level (month or
year). If, after completing the survey, you acquire a more accurate
ignition date, you may go back into the Monitor app and edit the fire
ignition date in the Fire Severity Module (see 4.1 Time since
fire).</p></li>
<li><p>Record your starting point from the drop-down list (i.e. N2, N4,
S2, S4, E2, E4, W2 or W4). This records the transect you are on and the
direction you are travelling in (e.g. ‘N2’ means you are starting at the
northern end of transect 2 and moving from north to south, while ‘S4’
means you are starting at the southern end and of transect 4 and moving
from south to north).</p></li>
<li><p>Place the bottom of the staff at the 0 m mark of the tape
measure. Ensure the staff is vertical and the laser pointer is pointing
downwards so the laser beam will intercept the ground near the base of
the staff.</p></li>
<li><p>For each point-intercept, begin by recording the nature of the
substrate that is intercepted by the laser beam. Press the button on the
laser pointer. If the laser beam is intercepted by vegetation, move the
vegetation aside so that the laser beam reaches the substrate. Flag the
substrate as <em>charred</em> or <em>scorched</em> where relevant (see<a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>If undertaking the Enhanced Cover protocol, record the vascular
plants that are intercepted with the laser pointer, touching the staff
between the laser pointer and the densitometer, and/or intercepting the
vertical line of sight through the densitometer. Where a part of a plant
of the same species and growth form is being intercepted at different
heights, the uppermost intercept is recorded as a hit and all lower
intercepts are ignored. This rule holds true for multiple intercepts of
the same species and growth form (see <a href="#appendices">Appendix</a>). Record the plant's
species name and growth form along with the uppermost height of the
point-intercept. Intercept height should be recorded in meters rounded
to the nearest centimetre from the markings on the staff.</p></li>
<li><p>If undertaking the Standard Cover protocol<em>,</em> record the
fractional cover (<em>photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic
vegetation, branch</em>) of the vascular plants that are intercepted
with the laser pointer, touching the staff between the laser pointer and
the densitometer, and/or intercepting the vertical line of sight through
the densitometer, along with the height of each intercept.</p></li>
<li><p>If the intercepted plant is dead, flag as <em>dead</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Flag if the part of the plant
being intercepted is <em>charred</em> or <em>scorched</em> (<a href="#table-1">Table 1</a>;

<li><p>If no part of the foliage or branches are sighted in the cross
hairs of the densitometer but the vertical line of sight is still within
the canopy boundary of <u>live</u> plants only, flag as <em>in canopy
sky</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Flag if the part of the plant
    being intercepted is resprouting. Record if the resprouting type is
    <em>basal</em>, <em>epicormic</em> or <em>apical</em> (<a href="#table-1">Table 1</a>; <a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>).</p></li>
<img alt="Resprouting" height="400" id="figure-3" src="https://w3id.org/tern/static/dawe-rlp/latest/fire/Picture3_Resprouting.png" width="800"/>
<li><p>If undertaking the Enhanced Cover protocol and the plant is
<em>dead</em>, <em>charred</em> or <em>scorched</em> and you cannot
determine what the species is, record the growth form (pre-recorded
field names; e.g. <em>shrub</em>, <em>tree</em>) and flag it as
<em>dead</em>, <em>charred</em> or <em>scorched</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 13 to 18 for all other plant species that are

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Fire is a prevalent ecological process in Australia that shapes
landscape patterns and ecosystem processes through its influence on
vegetation distribution and structure (Bond and Keeley 2005; Bowman
<em>et al.</em> 2009), and to which flora and fauna are adapted (Johnson
1995; Gosper <em>et al.</em> 2012; Gordon <em>et al.</em> 2017).
However, fire frequency, duration, extent and intensity, and the length
of the fire season, are predicted to increase in Australia in response
to climatic drivers and natural and anthropogenic disturbances (Bowman
<em>et al.</em> 2020; Etchells <em>et al.</em> 2020; Godfree <em>et
al.</em> 2021). The predicted shift in Australia's fire regime will
likely have critical consequences for biodiversity, landscape patterns
and ecosystem processes due to increased fire severity and associated
changes in post-fire recovery. Understanding fire severity is,
therefore, pivotal to ensure that adaptive management strategies
suitable for the prevailing fire regime can be developed.</p>
<p>Fire severity is commonly described in discrete categorical classes
that range from unburnt or low to high or extreme (see <a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>), with
the classes and parameters used to distinguish these categories varying
considerably between studies (Chafer <em>et al.</em> 2004; Hammill and
Bradstock 2006; Russell-Smith and Edwards 2006; Chafer 2008).
Furthermore, Australia's states and territories all map and assess fire
severity differently, which has led to inconsistent and incomplete
datasets. The lack of standardised data inhibits the ability to
accurately quantify the scale and ecological impact of fires across the
country (Bowman <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>
<p>Field-based fire severity classification is predominantly based on a
visual estimate of the degree of impact from a fire, including estimates
of the cover of burnt material in each stratum and comparisons to
reference photographs of each class (Chafer <em>et al.</em> 2004;
Hammill and Bradstock 2006; Russell-Smith and Edwards 2006; Chafer 2008)
However, this approach can lead to classification discrepancies due to
differences in observer interpretation (Chafer <em>et al.</em> 2004).
Similarly, estimating vegetation cover visually using cover classes
(e.g. Braun-Blanquet 1932) can be biased, imprecise and poor at
detecting change since classes are often too broad (Vittoz and Guisan
2007; Godínez-Alvarez <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p>
<p>Rather than visually classifying a plot into a fire severity
category, the Fire Severity Module collects quantitative field
measurements of fire severity attributes using the point-intercept
method, which is an objective, repeatable and precise method to assess
cover for all strata (Vittoz and Guisan 2007; Godínez-Alvarez <em>et
al.</em> 2009; Bonham 2013). The method is straightforward and allows
for detailed spatial and temporal comparisons of changes in cover
between plot samples with minimal uncertainty arising from the
measurement method or observer variation (Guerin <em>et al.</em> 2017),
(Brady <em>et al.</em> 1995) The quantitative field measurements can
also be used to develop continuous fire severity indices (Edwards <em>et
al.</em> 2013).</p>
<p>Data is collected from a total of 404 point-intercepts along four 100
m transects in a grid layout (2 N/S and 2 E/W). This provides a reliable
measure of the cover and patchiness of burnt and unburnt substrate and
vegetation in each stratum and is appropriate for detecting overall
change at the plot level. Measuring patchiness provides insight into the
implications on population dynamics of fire-interval-sensitive plant
species, with small amounts of patchiness being shown to substantially
enhance their survival (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2015). Furthermore,
measures of patchiness can provide insight into the potential impacts of
fire on fauna (Noske 1992; Trainor <em>et al.</em> 2000; Fraser <em>et
al.</em> 2003; Andersen <em>et al.</em> 2005). See the Cover Module for
a detailed rationale of the point-intercept method.</p>
<p>The attributes used to quantify fire severity in the plot were
selected based on those commonly used to classify fire severity (Whight
and Bradstock 1999; Hammill and Bradstock 2006; Russell-Smith and
Edwards 2006; Chafer 2008; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2015) and used in
fire severity indices (Whight and Bradstock 1999; Key and Benson 2006;
Jain <em>et al.</em> 2008), as well as their capacity to be easily
collected using the point-intercept method (Edwards <em>et al.</em>
2013; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2015). The latter allows the Fire
Severity Module to be undertaken simultaneously with the Cover Module,
with the fire severity data collected and the respective cover data at
each point-intercept.</p>
<p>Maximum trunk char height is measured from four sampling locations
within the plot, where the four point-intercept transects intersect.
This is an important indicator of fire severity (Chafer 2008; Keeley
2009; Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2013; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2015),
which is unlikely to be sampled adequately using the point-intercept
method due to the vertical orientation of tree trunks. Furthermore,
trunk char height may be used as a surrogate for flame height and is
thus a potential post-fire indicator of fire intensity (Williams <em>et
al.</em> 2003).</p>
<p>Time since fire is recorded based on on-ground knowledge and
available datasets. The time since fire that a survey is undertaken
influences the ecological character of fire severity through first-order
effects, including delayed survivorship and mortality. Survivorship can
diminish measures of fire severity as burnt vegetation remains viable
and regenerates. For this reason, the cover of regenerating vegetation
is also recorded. Conversely, delayed mortality can inflate fire
severity measures when apparently healthy vegetation is in fact damaged
by heat to the extent that it dies over time (Key 2006). For these
reasons, temporal information accompanying the fire severity measures is
recorded to ensure the correct interpretation and comparison of the
data.</p>

      <h1 id="introduction-and-background">Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>The Condition Module involves the collection of quantitative,
accurate and repeatable measures of condition within the plot, using a
combination of point and plot-based methods. The Condition Module
includes methods for collecting data on plant age class structure, plant
health and size, litter depth, coarse woody debris and recruitment.
Elements of the Coarse Woody Debris Module and Recruitment Module form
part of the Condition Module and data from other modules such as
Floristics, Cover, Fire Severity and Signs-based Fauna Surveys are also
important measures for the overall assessment of condition. The
definition of condition adopted here is revised from the AusPlots Draft
Condition Protocol (Wundke <em>et al.</em> 2015) and is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Biodiversity condition is a measure of the status of the biota at
an assessment site described by key attributes that reflect structure,
function and composition.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Condition Module has been designed to improve consistency and
repeatability in the way condition is measured across Australia and
provide increased opportunities for analysis. The primary aim of the
Condition Module is to collect baseline and revisit data, so any changes
in condition metrics following management interventions can be
evaluated.</p>
<p>Existing frameworks and procedures to assess condition differ in
their approach, and this is reflective of the range of legislative,
management and policy objectives in place, as well as available
resources (Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Methods and protocols for
assessing and monitoring condition have been developed in all states and
territories (Williams 2010), and include BioCondition in Queensland
(Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015), the Biodiversity Assessment Method (BAM) in
New South Wales (DPIE 2020), Habitat Hectare Assessment in Victoria (DSE
2004), TasVeg in Tasmania (Michaels 2006), Bushland Condition Monitoring
(BCM) in South Australia (Milne et al. 2008), Vegetation Condition
Assessment in the Northern Territory (Brocklehurst and Price 2008) and
Native Vegetation Condition Assessment in Western Australia (Casson et
al. 2009). However, the degree these methods have been adopted and
utilised varies between states and territories.</p>
<p>The methods developed by the states and territories have generally
been designed as practical, rapid assessments, appropriate for use by
non-specialists. All have a measure of species composition, plant cover,
life history, weeds and logs (coarse woody debris), and all assess
regeneration or recruitment of canopy or woody species as a measure of
ecosystem function. To measure condition, these methods generally
involve comparison against a reference or benchmark (Williams 2010). The
methods provided here build from the approach developed for the AusPlots
Draft Condition Protocols Manual (Wundke <em>et al.</em> 2015) and align
with existing state and territory methods, where possible.</p>
<p>As more attributes are assessed, the overall picture of biodiversity
condition becomes more comprehensive (Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009).
However, one of the main challenges for developing condition protocols,
is deciding on a set of attributes that are flexible enough to be
applied across Australia, but are also robust, repeatable and cost
effective (NERP National Condition Working Group 2015). The condition
assessment framework presented here, draws on data from a range of
attributes, sourced from a number of the modules, including a core set
from the Condition Module, as well as data from the Recruitment Module,
Coarse Woody Debris Module, Fire Severity Module, Signs-based Fauna
Surveys Module, Floristics Module, and Cover Module. Where required,
condition assessments can also include data from other modules,
including Vertebrate Fauna Module, Invertebrate Fauna Module and Soils
Module.</p>
<p>The key attributes that should be considered as part of a condition
assessments include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>plant age class structure (Condition Module and Recruitment
Module)</p></li>
<li><p>life-stage and growth stage (Condition Module and Recruitment

<li><p>plant health (Condition Module)</p></li>

<h3 id="analysing-condition-data">Analysing condition data</h3>
<p>Condition is generally assessed by measuring a range of features and
then combining these into an index of condition, which is then compared
against a benchmark to generate a condition score (Cook et al. 2010).
Benchmarks are generally based on a pre-European (1750) state, prior to
significant development and disturbance (Thackway et al. 2015), or a
Best on Offer site (BOO, Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2017). Once a set of
benchmarks have been established for a vegetation type, the condition of
any example of that type can be quantified by comparing the site values
with the benchmark values (Parkes <em>et al.</em> 2003; Eyre <em>et
al.</em> 2015). Condition scores can be generated from a mix of field
and remote measures (Eyre et al. 2015; Harwood et al. 2016; Lawley et
al. 2016; McFarlane and Wallace 2019), and to generate condition scores,
primary data is usually converted into an attribute condition score, and
then weighted and aggregated into a single site multi-metric score
(Oliver <em>et al.</em> 2014; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015). This approach
can be straightforward and easy to understand, and allows a range of
information to be presented as a simple numeric or visual summary (Pert
et al. 2012). However, multi-metric condition scores have two main
shortcomings including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>loss of useful information at the attribute level, and</p></li>
<li><p>generation of similar condition scores for very different sites
through attribute eclipsing - the absence of one attribute being
compensated for by the presence of another (Oliver <em>et al.</em>
2014).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative approach is to assess each condition attribute
individually against a baseline or reference measure. This approach
avoids masking individual attribute scores, which allows a more thorough
understanding of the outcomes of management actions (ESCAVI 2007; Milne
et al. 2008), and as such is the approach recommended here. In addition,
benchmarks are incomplete and lack consistency across Australia and
given these limitations, alternative analysis options are required (Eco
Logical Australia 2013).</p>
<p>The collection of condition data using this protocol is focused on
recording continuous rather than categorial data, as this allows
flexibility when analysing and interpreting data. Collecting data in
this way allows changes in individual attributes to be monitored,
aggregated and analysed to explore a range of issues related to
vegetation condition (Williams 2010). Analysis can be undertaken in a
range of ways or a combination of ways, using the data collected,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Comparison of intervention (treatment) and control plots over
time, against baseline plot measures.</p></li>
<li><p>Generation of benchmarks from suitable nearby reference areas
using the same plot methods, to allow comparison of condition attributes
from intervention or development areas, against relatively unmodified or
best on offer reference areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilisation of state or territory benchmark data and associated
scoring algorithms, where available, to generate condition scores for
the plots studied.</p></li>
<li><p>Generation of a new scoring algorithm using the plot data
collected and benchmark plots, to generate a condition score for each
plot studied (the condition attributes included can be tailored to
project needs and weighted accordingly).</p></li>
