<li>For each specimen, assign a field name. Where you are confident of the identification, the field name should be a definitive species name. Where the identification is unknown, it should be given a descriptive name (e.g. &lsquo;yellow daisy flower&rsquo;). The field name given during this step should be used as the field name for the point-intercept data collection every time that species is encountered (see the Cover module).</li>
<li>For each specimen, scan the voucher label into the App by pressing the &lsquo;Scan a voucher&rsquo; button (Figure 6).

<li>Once scanned, the App will ask for a growth form and provide a drop-down list of growth forms to select from. If there is a second growth form of a species, select this from the &lsquo;Growth Form #2&rsquo; drop-down list. Press the &lsquo;i&rsquo; (information) button for a summary of each growth form.</li>
<li>If required, take a photo/s of the specimen or an in situ individual by pressing the &lsquo;Photo&rsquo; button. A photo reference scale should be used in each photo.</li>
<li>If collecting plant tissue vouchers, press the &lsquo;Collect plant tissue voucher&rsquo; button to navigate to the Plant tissue vouchering module. Once the associated plant tissue voucher barcode label is scanned into the App, return to the Floristics module.</li>
<li>Press the &lsquo;Save&rsquo; button to save the species record and begin recording the next species.</li>
<li>Once all species have been recorded and their voucher barcode scanned, press the &lsquo;Complete Module&rsquo; button to return to the &lsquo;Module Selection&rsquo; screen.</li>
<li>After labelling and scanning each specimen, place larger specimens directly into a plastic bag, and smaller specimens into paper bags, then the plastic bag, ready for transferring to a plant press.</li>
<li>Place the voucher specimen of each flora species in a plant press in the field (Figure 7), preferably before leaving each plot.</li>
<li>At the time of pressing, refer to the Plant tissue vouchering module for procedures and guidelines to collect leaf material from each voucher.

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Searching for species</p>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended that a single surveyor searches the plot (1 ha) for at least 60 minutes to record all the flora species present.</li>
<li>If the vegetation is sparse and/or has low diversity (either naturally of due to disturbance), a search time of 30&ndash;45 minutes may be suitable.</li>
<li>If the vegetation is dense and/or has high diversity, a search time of at least 90 minutes is recommended.</li>
<li>In each scenario, if no new species is recorded for 15 minutes, you can finish searching earlier.</li>
<li>Make a point of searching all micro-habitats within the plot (e.g. rocky escarpments, low points with/near water, litter underneath shrubs and trees, further away from the disturbances).</li>
<li>Other surveyors can help by informing on any uncommon or inconspicuous species observed while setting up/completing other modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Species identification</p>
<ul>
<li>When entering a field name for your vouchers it is essential that the field name makes sense to you as it will be used in subsequent modules for data collection. The name can be anything, but it is essential that the name is used on every occasion that you are detailing that species; you must be consistent with its use over the project area! Your field names will not be made publicly available when the plot data is published, however herbarium staff will have access to your field names.</li>
<li>Avoid using labels such as &lsquo;Acacia sp.&rsquo;, use a descriptive word instead of &lsquo;sp.&rsquo; (e.g. &lsquo;Acacia spiky&rsquo;) this saves confusion later regarding whether it was a genuine species in a non-identifiable vegetative form or not.</li>
<li>Use consistent taxonomy across the jurisdictions following published names used in the Australian Plant Name Index.</li>
<li>A photo should be taken for unknown species that have been assigned a field name to help identify them when surveying other plots or completing other modules (e.g. Cover, Vegetation mapping).</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting vouchers</p>
<ul>
<li>Permits are required to collect flora voucher specimens and they must be collected in accordance with the conditions and guidelines in each jurisdictional permit.</li>
<li>Collection of flora vouchers of rare, threatened or endangered species should only be made when such actions would not jeopardise the continued existence of the population. Collection of threatened species may require additional information to be obtained to fulfil permitting conditions requirements.</li>
<li>If collecting a voucher specimen would jeopardise the continued existence of a rare, threatened or endangered flora population, the following can serve as the required voucher (listed in decreasing order of preference):</li>
<li>Portion of fertile plant without the root.</li>
<li>Photos of plant in conjunction with piece of fertile plant or plant parts (leaves and flowers or fruits).</li>
<li>Photos of fertile plant in conjunction with sterile plant specimen.</li>
<li>Sterile plant specimen only, or photos only.</li>
<li>Discretion should be used in the case of re-visited populations of rare, threatened or endangered flora during monitoring programs as it may not be necessary to document each observation with a specimen.</li>
<li>To aid identification, each voucher should ideally include when available: flowers or buds, leaves, fruit and bark (for trees). See Figure 8 for an example. Try to minimise the number of individual specimens needed to represent each species by maximising the number of plant components (e.g. flowers, fruit, leaves) on each sample collected.

</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>if available, collect young, actively growing material for plant tissue vouchering. Although it is inevitable that during some surveys only sterile or vegetative material will be available, such material should still be collected. The quantity of leaf material collected needs to be sufficient to enable removal of samples for genetic profiling (equivalent to approximately 10 cm2 or five eucalypt leaves). For small plants, this may require collection of at least two specimens &ndash; one to be vouchered and one for a plant tissue sample.</li>
<li>For small species, collect the whole plant, including the basal material and roots, particularly for Gramineae (Poaceae), Cyperaceae and Juncaceae. See Figure 9 for an example.

</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>For small annuals and ephemerals, collect a number of individuals.</li>
<li>For wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper to assist drying-out.</li>
<li>For small wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper and place them in a small snap-lock bag or paper bag until ready for pressing.</li>
<li>Ideally specimens should be placed into the plant press before leaving each plot. However, as a minimum requirement, press specimens by the end of each day&rsquo;s field work. Pressing plants in the field ensures that none are lost and also speeds up the identification process as diagnostic characters will be better preserved soon after collection.</li>
<li>When pressing, use one folded tabloid sized newspaper sheet for each specimen and use corrugated cardboard dividers frequently &ndash; to a maximum of one cardboard between every fifth specimen or more frequently for bulky specimens.</li>
<li>Change the newspaper regularly to prevent specimens becoming mouldy. Frequent changes will be necessary if specimens were damp when collected.</li>
<li>Keep succulent plants in a separate press to facilitate more frequent changing of papers and reduce the risk of damaging other specimens.</li>
<li>Succulent plants are difficult to dry and can be frozen overnight (either in the field or on return to the office) to fracture the cell walls enabling the moisture to escape. Once frozen, the specimen can be transferred to newspaper and cardboard in the press for the plot which it was recorded from.</li>
<li>A photo may be useful to assist in the accurate identification of a species, particularly for species where colour is important to identification but may not be preserved in the dried specimen.</li>
