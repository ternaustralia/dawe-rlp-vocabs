<h2 id="field-collection-1">Field Collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites-1">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Generate area checklists from Atlas of Living Australia,
Australasian Virtual Herbarium or herbaria electronic floras, including
known, threatened, and sensitive species from the project area.</p></li>
<li><p>Become familiar with the characters and habitat requirements of
threatened and sensitive species potentially occurring in the project
area.</p></li>
<li><p>Become familiar with the TERN Vascular Plant Collection
Guidelines.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-estimate">Time estimate</h3>
<p>Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and
experience of personnel, their familiarity with the flora of the region,
the species richness and cover within the plot, and the number of plant
specimen vouchers versus plant photo vouchers required.</p>
<p>As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow between 0.5–1.5 hours to search for flora species and
collect plant specimen and plant photo vouchers from the plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow between 0.5–1 hour to prepare plant specimen vouchers,
attach voucher labels, enter and scan the species into the app, and
transfer the specimens to a field press.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow approximately 10 minutes per field press, every 2–3 days
during the field survey, to inspect and change newspaper if
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 1–2 hours after the field survey to deliver the plant
specimen vouchers to the local State or Territory herbarium.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-1">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Searching the plot and collecting a plant specimen voucher or
plant photo voucher for all flora species present is best conducted with
two personnel, one collecting plant specimens and the other recording
plant photo vouchers directly into the app. This also enables more
ground, including microhabitats, to be covered from multiple
viewpoints.</p></li>
<li><p>Processing plant specimen vouchers is best conducted with two
personnel, one processing the specimens and one recording the data
directly into the app.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyors making the observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying the flora species of the region. If surveyors
are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising, using field
reference guides, and seeking advice before conducting this
protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Floristics surveys involve the collection of plant specimen
vouchers. Therefore, scientific permits are likely to be required.
Additional permits may be required for collecting threatened flora
species, so always check with your local authority.</p></li>

    <h3 id="additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="survey-timing-1">Survey timing</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The Floristics Module is best undertaken during the main plant
emergence and reproduction period, which may vary based on survey scope,
location and season. Although it is possible to survey flora outside of
this period, the total number of species will likely be underestimated.
Considerable effort is required to locate signs of seasonal species, and
even this is unlikely to compensate for the effect of sub-optimal survey
timing (Casson et al. 2009).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="searching-for-species-1">Searching for
species</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The surveyor/s should systematically meander around the plot to
ensure the whole plot is searched. Partitioning the plot into quarters
or belt transects is recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>If the vegetation is sparse and/or has low diversity (either
naturally or due to disturbance), a search time of 30–45 minutes may be
suitable.</p></li>
<li><p>If the vegetation is dense and/or has high diversity, a search
time of at least 90 minutes is recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Search times should be increased for inexperienced
surveyors.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a point of searching all micro-habitats within the plot
(e.g. rocky escarpments, low points with/near water, litter underneath
shrubs and trees, further away from any disturbances).</p></li>
<li><p>Other surveyors can help by informing on any uncommon or
inconspicuous species observed while setting up/undertaking other
modules.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="assigning-field-names-1">Assigning field
names</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>When you assign a definitive species name, use current names
published in the Australian Plant Census for consistent taxonomy across
the jurisdictions.</p></li>
<li><p>When assigning a field name, it is essential that the field name
makes sense to you as it will be used in subsequent modules for data
collection. The name can be anything, but it is essential that the name
is used on every occasion that you are detailing that species; you must
be consistent with its use in the plot and over the project area. Your
field names will not be made publicly available when the plot data is
published, however herbarium staff will have access to your field
names.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid using labels such as <em>Acacia</em> sp., use a descriptive
word instead (e.g. <em>Acacia</em> spiky). This saves confusion later
regarding whether it was a genuine species in a non-identifiable
vegetative form or not.</p></li>
<li><p>A photo should be taken for unknown species that have been
assigned a field name to help identify them when surveying other plots
or completing other modules (e.g. Cover Module).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="taking-plant-photo-vouchers">Taking plant
photo vouchers</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Try to ensure you photograph a plant that has good vigour and is
representative of the species within the plot (i.e. try to avoid
photographing plants that are not typical for the species).</p></li>
<li><p>Take a photo that shows the overall growth form of the plant (see
<a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a>), as the distinctions in growth form may not be apparent to
the surveyor, but crucial to identification.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t forget about the below-ground parts of the plant. Many
smaller plants have distinctive characteristics or structures attached
to their roots, rhizomes, or storage organs (tubers, bulbs, corms) that
can be used to accurately identify them.</p></li>
<li><p>Photos need to be in focus, not too light or too dark, and the
colour should accurately reflect what you are seeing with your eye when
you take the photo.</p></li>
<li><p>A suitable photographic reference scale should be used depending
on the species/feature being photographed. For example, a range pole
should be placed against the trunk of a tree being photographed, and a
bank card sized scale should be used in a photo of a feature such as a
flower or fruit (see <a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a>). If you do not have an actual reference
scale, use something you have on hand to provide a reference (e.g. pen,
pencil, compass).</p></li>
<li><p>The staff used to mount the densitometer (see the Cover Module)
can double as a scale for photographs.</p></li>
<li><p>A spare camera should be taken on field surveys as a backup in
case of any storage or camera issues with your mobile device. The app
allows for the input of a photo number in each of the photo collection
fields.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="collecting-plant-specimen-vouchers-1">Collecting plant specimen
vouchers</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>A day press should be used during specimen collection to maintain
their integrity. If one is not available, an individual paper bag per
specimen can be used, each stored within a larger plastic bag during
collection, and specimens should be promptly transferred to a field
press.</p></li>
<li><p>Once a handful of specimens are collected, transfer them to the
day press. Specimens from two species can be stored in the same
newspaper sheet. However, avoid putting similar species (e.g. grasses,
same genera) in the same sheet to prevent mixing diagnostic characters
(e.g. seeds, fruit).</p></li>
<li><p>Permits are required to collect specimens and they must be
collected in accordance with the conditions and guidelines for each
jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional scientific permits may be required to collect
threatened species. Check with appropriate jurisdictions to ensure
permits are obtained, and conditions are understood. A threatened
species collection permit may require additional data to be collected,
and voucher submission to the respective herbaria.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of specimens of rare, threatened or endangered species
should only be made when such actions would not jeopardise the continued
existence of the population.</p></li>
<li><p>If collecting a specimen would jeopardise the continued existence
of a rare, threatened or endangered flora population, the following can
serve as a specimen (listed in decreasing order of preference):</p>
<p>portion of fertile plant without the root.</p>
<p>photos of plant in conjunction with a piece of fertile plant or plant
parts (leaves and flowers or fruits).</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>photos of fertile plant in conjunction with sterile plant
specimen.</p></li>
<li><p>sterile plant specimen only, or photos only.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Discretion should be used in the case of re-visited populations
of rare, threatened or endangered flora during monitoring programs as it
may not be necessary to document each observation with an additional
specimen.</p></li>
<li><p>To aid identification, each specimen should ideally include when
available: vegetative material (i.e. leaves, phyllodes), flowers or
buds, fruit and bark (for trees). For particular groups, ensure material
that includes diagnostic characters is included to aid in identification
based on morphology. Try to minimise the number of individual specimens
needed to represent each species by maximising the number of plant
components (e.g. flowers, fruit, leaves) on each specimen
collected.</p></li>
<li><p>If also undertaking the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1f2ac884-2177-403a-a6c3-27e109b1fc95">Plant Tissue Vouchering Module</a>, collect
young, actively growing material if available. Although it is inevitable
that during some surveys only sterile or vegetative material will be
available, such material should still be collected. The quantity of leaf
material collected needs to be sufficient to enable removal of samples
for genetic profiling (equivalent to approximately 10 cm<sup>2</sup> or
five eucalypt leaves). For small plants, this may require collection of
at least two specimens – one for a plant specimen voucher and one for a
plant tissue voucher.</p></li>
<li><p>For small species, collect the whole plant, including the basal
material and roots, particularly for Gramineae (Poaceae), Cyperaceae and
Juncaceae (<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1B</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>For small annuals and ephemerals, collect a number of individuals
(<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1C</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>For specimens that you anticipate herbaria will wish to lodge
(e.g. species of interest to the herbaria determined from pre-survey
consultation), a duplicate should be collected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="pressing-plant-specimen-vouchers-1">Pressing
plant specimen vouchers</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure not too much material is in the newspaper sheet and the
specimen is laid out flat as the specimen will not press and dry
properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that a separate batch of sequential voucher barcode labels
is used for plant specimen vouchers, plant tissue vouchers, fauna
vouchers, and soil samples. Therefore, care is needed to ensure the
correct label is being used.</p></li>
<li><p>Sheets of foam the size of the press can be used when pressing
bulky items to make pressing easier and retain the integrity of the
specimens.</p></li>
<li><p>For wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper to assist drying-out,
or store in a vial with Kew mixture. Blotting paper can also be used to
absorb moisture and assist in drying.</p></li>
<li><p>For small wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper and place them in
a small snap-lock bag or paper bag until ready for pressing, or store in
a vial with Kew mixture.</p></li>
<li><p>Specimens should be placed into a field press before leaving each
plot to ensure that none are lost and that diagnostic characters will be
better preserved.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the newspaper regularly to prevent specimens becoming
mouldy. Frequent changes will be necessary if specimens were damp when
collected.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep succulent plants in a separate press to facilitate more
frequent changing of papers and reduce the risk of damaging other
specimens.</p></li>
<li><p>Succulent plants are difficult to dry and can be frozen overnight
(either in the field or on return to the office) to fracture the cell
walls enabling the moisture to escape. Once frozen, the specimen can be
transferred to newspaper and cardboard in the press for the plot which
it was recorded from.</p></li>
<li><p>A field herbarium dryer may be used (especially in the tropics)
to avoid specimens going mouldy.</p></li>
<li><p>A photo may be useful to assist in the accurate identification of
a species, particularly for species where colour is important to
identification but may not be preserved in the dried specimen.</p></li>

   <h3 id="instructions-and-procedures">Instructions and Procedures</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ensure the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout Module</a> has been completed to
mark out the plot boundary and define the current plot and visit in the
Monitor app.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Search the entire plot for each flora species present. Search
between 30 and 90 minutes or more depending on the diversity and density
of the vegetation and surveyor experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect specimens for new, unknown, important, contentious and
threatened species (see Key definitions and terminology in <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics</a>) present within the plot, storing them
in a day press. Take enough material to cover an A3 size herbarium sheet
(<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1A</a>). If the species is small, a whole plant specimen/s including
basal material and roots should be collected (<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1B</a> and <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1C</a>).
Collect extra material if required for plant tissue vouchers (see the
<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1f2ac884-2177-403a-a6c3-27e109b1fc95">Plant Tissue Vouchering Module</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>While searching the plot, select the Floristics Module and then
the Standard protocol in the Monitor app to record and photograph flora
species that do not require a plant specimen voucher as they are
encountered. If you encounter an epiphyte, mistletoe or parasite that
does not require plant specimen voucher, record or process the host
species first so that you can link epiphyte, mistletoe or parasite
species to its host in the app.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify if the standard protocol of the Plant Tissue Vouchering
Module will be undertaken at the same time as the Floristics Module.
This will enable a button to open a popup of the Plant Tissue Vouchering
Module.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the relevant <em>floristics voucher</em> for each flora
species observed that does not require a plant specimen (i.e. those
recorded from a previous plot or survey within the project
area).</p></li>
<li><p>The app will automatically assign the <em>field name</em>,
<em>voucher barcode</em>, <em>growth form 1</em> and <em>growth form
2</em> previously allocated to the species. Check the correct growth
form is selected for the record from the current plot and edit from the
list of NVIS growth forms if necessary (<a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>If ephiphyte is selected as a growth form, record the <em>host
species</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>habit</em> (optional), selecting all terms that
apply to the species (<a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Take plant photo vouchers of the species by selecting the
relevant <em>camera</em> buttons, including all diagnostic features
present. A <em>plant photo</em> and <em>leaf photo</em> are required. It
is optional to take a <em>flower photo</em>, <em>bud photo</em>,
<em>fruit photo</em>, <em>seed photo</em>, <em>stem photo, bark photo,
roots photo</em>, or <em>other photo</em>. Use a photo reference scale
in each photo. Record a <em>comment</em> (optional) of each photo if
required. Example plant photo vouchers are provided in <a href="#appendix-4">Appendix 4</a>.
Instructions and guidelines for taking plant photo vouchers are provided
in <a href="#appendix-5">Appendix 5</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>save species record</em> button to save the
current species record.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>add another species</em> button to begin recording
another flora species that does not require a plant specimen voucher and
repeat steps 6–11.</p></li>
<li><p>Return to the field vehicle or a designated area with the
equipment required to process the specimens for new, unknown, important,
contentious and threatened species. If you have collected an epiphyte,
mistletoe or parasite, process the host species first so that you can
link epiphyte, mistletoe or parasite species to its host in the
app.</p></li>
<li><p>Label each specimen securely with a unique voucher barcode label.
Place the label on stems or away from any plant parts that will need to
be examined for identification purposes (see <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>). Use paper
envelopes for small specimens and attach the label to the envelope. Use
vials with Kew mixture for delicate specimens and attach the label to
the vial.</p></li>
<li><p>For each specimen, assign a <em>field name</em>. Assign a
definitive species name if you are confident of the identification. If
not, assign a descriptive name (e.g. yellow daisy flower) that can be
easily remembered and distinguished from descriptive names assigned to
other species.</p></li>
<li><p>For each specimen, scan the <em>voucher barcode</em> into the app
by selecting the <em>record voucher barcode</em> button.</p></li>
<li><p>Record <em>growth form 1</em> from the list of NVIS growth forms
(<a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>). Record <em>growth form 2</em> (optional) if a second,
sub-dominant growth form is observed. Once a growth form is selected,
its description will appear in the app. Check this to ensure you have
selected the correct growth form.</p></li>
<li><p>If ephiphyte is selected as a growth form, record the
<em>host</em> <em>species</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>habit</em> (optional), selecting all terms that
apply to the species (<a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>phenology</em> (optional), selecting all
attributes relevant to the specimen (<a href="#appendix-3">Appendix 3</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>If required, take a <em>photo</em> (optional) of the specimen or
an individual from within the plot by selecting the <em>camera</em>
button. Use a photo reference scale in each photo (see <a href="#appendix-4">Appendix 4</a>).
Record a <em>comment</em> (optional) of the photo if required. Take
multiple photos if required.</p></li>
<li><p>If collecting plant tissue vouchers, select the <em>plant tissue
voucher</em> button to open a popup of the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1f2ac884-2177-403a-a6c3-27e109b1fc95">Plant Tissue Vouchering Module</a>. Once the associated plant tissue voucher barcode label is
scanned into the app, return to the Standard protocol in the Floristics
Module.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>save species record</em> button to save the
current species record.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the plant specimen voucher into a field press for long term
storage and drying (<a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>). Use one folded tabloid sized newspaper
sheet for each specimen and use corrugated cardboard dividers frequently
(at least one cardboard between every fifth specimen or more frequently
for bulky specimens).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>add another species</em> button to begin recording
another new, unknown, important, contentious and threatened species
record and repeat steps 14–24.</p>
<p>Once all new, unknown, important, contentious and threatened species
have been recorded and their voucher barcode scanned, spl,anelect the
<em>complete floristics component</em> button and queue the floristics
collection for submission.</p></li>
<li><p>Close the field press and tighten the straps. Label the plant
press using a permanent marker on the top sheet of cardboard with the
<em>plot number</em> and <em>date</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Inspect the field press every 2–3 days during the field survey
and replace newspaper when necessary.</p></li>
