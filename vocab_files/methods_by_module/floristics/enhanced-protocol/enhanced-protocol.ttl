<h2 id="field-collection">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Generate area checklists from Atlas of Living Australia,
Australasian Virtual Herbarium or herbaria electronic floras, including
known, threatened, and sensitive species from the project area.</p></li>
<li><p>Become familiar with the characters and habitat requirements of
threatened and sensitive species potentially occurring in the project
area.</p></li>
<li><p>Become familiar with the TERN Vascular Plant Collection
Guidelines.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey time requirements will vary depending on the number and
experience of personnel, their familiarity with the flora of the region,
and the species richness and cover within the plot.</p>
<p>As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow between 0.5–1.5 hours to search for flora species and
collect plant specimen vouchers from the plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow between 0.5–1.5 hours to prepare plant specimen vouchers,
attach voucher labels, enter and scan the species into the app, and
transfer the specimens to a field press.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow approximately 10 minutes per field press, every 2–3 days
during the field survey, to inspect and change newspaper if
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 1–2 hours after the field survey to deliver the plant
specimen vouchers to the local State or Territory herbarium.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Searching the plot and collecting a plant specimen voucher for
all flora species present is best conducted with two personnel. This
enables more ground, including microhabitats, to be covered from
multiple viewpoints.</p></li>
<li><p>Processing plant specimen vouchers is best conducted with two
personnel, one processing the specimens and one recording the data
directly into the app.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyors making the observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying the characteristic identifiable features of
flora species and how to distinguish one species from another. If
surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to practising,
using field reference guides, and seeking advice before conducting this
protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Floristics surveys involve the collection of plant specimen
vouchers. Therefore, scientific permits are likely to be required.
Additional permits may be required for collecting threatened flora
species, so always check with your local authority.</p></li>
</ul>

    <h3 id="additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="survey-timing">Survey timing</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The Floristics Module is best undertaken during the main plant
emergence and reproduction period, which may vary based on survey scope,
location and season. Although it is possible to survey flora outside of
this period, the total number of species will likely be underestimated.
Considerable effort is required to locate signs of seasonal species, and
even this is unlikely to compensate for the effect of sub-optimal survey
timing (Casson et al. 2009).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="searching-for-species">Searching for
species</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The surveyor/s should systematically meander around the plot to
ensure the whole plot is searched. Partitioning the plot into quarters
or belt transects is recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>If the vegetation is sparse and/or has low diversity (either
naturally or due to disturbance), a search time of 30–45 minutes may be
suitable.</p></li>
<li><p>If the vegetation is dense and/or has high diversity, a search
time of at least 90 minutes is recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Search times should be increased for inexperienced
surveyors.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a point of searching all micro-habitats within the plot
(e.g. rocky escarpments, low points with/near water, litter underneath
shrubs and trees, further away from any disturbances).</p></li>
<li><p>Other surveyors can help by informing on any uncommon or
inconspicuous species observed while setting up/undertaking other
modules.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="collecting-plant-specimen-vouchers">Collecting plant specimen
vouchers</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>A day press should be used during specimen collection to maintain
their integrity. If one is not available, an individual paper bag per
specimen can be used, each stored within a larger plastic bag during
collection, and specimens should be promptly transferred to a field
press.</p></li>
<li><p>Once a handful of specimens are collected, transfer them to the
day press. Specimens from two species can be stored in the same
newspaper sheet. However, avoid putting similar species (e.g. grasses,
same genera) in the same sheet to prevent mixing diagnostic characters
(e.g. seeds, fruit).</p></li>
<li><p>Permits are required to collect specimens and they must be
collected in accordance with the conditions and guidelines for each
jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional scientific permits may be required to collect
threatened species. Check with appropriate jurisdictions to ensure
permits are obtained, and conditions are understood. A threatened
species collection permit may require additional data to be collected,
and voucher submission to the respective herbaria.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of specimens of rare, threatened or endangered species
should only be made when such actions would not jeopardise the continued
existence of the population.</p></li>
<li><p>If collecting a specimen would jeopardise the continued existence
of a rare, threatened or endangered flora population, the following can
serve as a specimen (listed in decreasing order of preference):</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>portion of fertile plant without the root.</p></li>
<li><p>photos of plant in conjunction with a piece of fertile plant or
plant parts (leaves and flowers or fruits).</p></li>
<li><p>photos of fertile plant in conjunction with sterile plant
specimen.</p></li>
<li><p>sterile plant specimen only, or photos only.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Discretion should be used in the case of re-visited populations
of rare, threatened or endangered flora during monitoring programs as it
may not be necessary to document each observation with an additional
specimen.</p></li>
<li><p>To aid identification, each specimen should ideally include, when
available: vegetative material (i.e. leaves, phyllodes), flowers or
buds, fruit and bark (for trees). For particular groups, ensure material
that includes diagnostic characters is included to aid in identification
based on morphology. Try to minimise the number of individual specimens
needed to represent each species by maximising the number of plant
components (e.g. flowers, fruit, leaves) on each specimen
collected.</p></li>
<li><p>If also undertaking the Plant Tissue Vouchering Module, collect
young, actively growing material if available. Although it is inevitable
that during some surveys only sterile or vegetative material will be
available, such material should still be collected. The quantity of leaf
material collected needs to be sufficient to enable removal of samples
for genetic profiling (equivalent to approximately 10 cm<sup>2</sup> or
five eucalypt leaves). For small plants, this may require collection of
at least two specimens – one for a plant specimen voucher and one for a
plant tissue voucher.</p></li>
<li><p>For small species, collect the whole plant, including the basal
material and roots, particularly for Gramineae (Poaceae), Cyperaceae and
Juncaceae (Figure 1B).</p></li>
<li><p>For small annuals and ephemerals, collect a number of individuals
(Figure 1C).</p></li>
<li><p>For specimens that you anticipate herbaria will wish to lodge
(e.g. species of interest to the herbaria determined from pre-survey
consultation), a duplicate should be collected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="assigning-field-names">Assigning field
names</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>When you assign a definitive species name, use current names
published in the Australian Plant Census for consistent taxonomy across
the jurisdictions .</p></li>
<li><p>When assigning a field name, the field name must make sense to
you as it will be used in subsequent modules for data collection. The
name can be anything, but it is essential that the name is used on every
occasion that you are detailing that species; you must be consistent
with its use in the plot and over the project area. Your field names
will not be made publicly available when the plot data is published,
however herbarium staff will have access to your field names.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid using labels such as <em>Acacia</em> sp., use a descriptive
word instead (e.g. <em>Acacia</em> spiky). This saves confusion later
regarding whether it was a genuine species in a non-identifiable
vegetative form or not.</p></li>
<li><p>A photo should be taken for unknown species that have been
assigned a field name to help identify them when surveying other plots
or completing other modules (e.g. Cover Module).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="pressing-plant-specimen-vouchers">Pressing
plant specimen vouchers</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure not too much material is in the newspaper sheet and the
specimen is laid out flat as the specimen will not press and dry
properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that a separate batch of sequential voucher barcode labels
is used for plant specimen vouchers, plant tissue vouchers, fauna
vouchers, and soil samples. Therefore, care is needed to ensure the
correct label is being used.</p></li>
<li><p>Sheets of foam the size of the press can be used when pressing
bulky items to make pressing easier and retain the integrity of the
specimens.</p></li>
<li><p>For wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper to assist drying-out,
or store in a vial with Kew mixture. Blotting paper can also be used to
absorb moisture and assist in drying.</p></li>
<li><p>For small wet specimens, wrap them in newspaper and place them in
a small snap-lock bag or paper bag until ready for pressing, or store in
a vial with Kew mixture.</p></li>
<li><p>Specimens should be placed into a field press before leaving each
plot to ensure that none are lost and that diagnostic characters will be
better preserved.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the newspaper regularly to prevent specimens from becoming
mouldy. Frequent changes will be necessary if specimens were damp when
collected.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep succulent plants in a separate press to facilitate more
frequent changing of papers and reduce the risk of damaging other
specimens.</p></li>
<li><p>Succulent plants are difficult to dry and can be frozen overnight
(either in the field or on return to the office) to fracture the cell
walls enabling the moisture to escape. Once frozen, the specimen can be
transferred to newspaper and cardboard in the press for the plot which
it was recorded from.</p></li>
<li><p>A field herbarium dryer may be used (especially in the tropics)
to avoid specimens going mouldy.</p></li>
<li><p>A photo may be useful to assist in the accurate identification of
a species, particularly for species where colour is important to
identification but may not be preserved in the dried specimen.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="post-field-survey-tasks">Post-field survey tasks</h2>
<h3 id="sample-curation">Sample curation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Inspect the field press and change newspaper when
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Contact the local herbaria (or approved taxonomist) completing
the identifications to determine the procedures for lodging plant
specimen vouchers for identification (also see the Lodging EMSA
Specimens and Samples information sheet).</p></li>
<li><p>Check with the local herbaria (or approved taxonomist) completing
the identifications and provide the required associated information.
This is often a request form. Include the plot number, and location
details on the form, along with the associated barcodes and field
identification names, and information on the vegetation community that
may be beneficial.</p></li>

    <h3 id="instructions-and-procedures">Instructions and procedures</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ensure the Plot Selection and Layout Module has been completed to
mark out the plot boundary and define the current plot and visit in the
Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>Search the entire plot for each flora species present. Search
between 30 and 90 minutes or more depending on the diversity and density
of the vegetation and surveyor experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect specimens for each flora species present within the plot,
storing them in a day press. Take enough material for an A3 size
herbarium sheet (Figure 1A). If the species is small, a whole plant
specimen/s including basal material and roots should be collected
(Figure 1B and Figure 1C). Collect extra material for plant tissue
vouchers if required (see the Plant Tissue Vouchering Module).</p></li>
<li><p>Return to the field vehicle or a designated area with the
equipment required to process the specimens. If you have collected an
epiphyte, mistletoe or parasite, process the host species first so that
you can link the epiphyte, mistletoe or parasite species to its host in
the app.</p></li>
<li><p>Label each specimen securely with a unique voucher barcode label.
Place the label on stems or away from any plant parts that will need to
be examined for identification purposes (see Figure 1). Use paper
envelopes for small specimens and attach the label to the envelope. Use
vials with Kew mixture for delicate specimens and attach the label to
the vial.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the Floristics Module and then the Enhanced protocol in
the Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>For each specimen, assign a <em>field name</em>. Assign a
definitive species name if you are confident of the identification. If
not, assign a descriptive name (e.g. yellow daisy flower) that can be
easily remembered and distinguished from descriptive names assigned to
other species.</p></li>

<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p>For each specimen, scan the <em>voucher barcode</em> into the app
by pressing the <em>record voucher barcode</em> button.</p></li>
<li><p>Record <em>growth form 1</em> from the list of NVIS growth forms
(<a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>). Record <em>growth form 2</em> if a second, sub-dominant
growth form is observed. Once a growth form is selected, its description
will appear in the app. Check this to ensure you have selected the
correct growth form.</p></li>
<li><p>If ephiphyte is selected as a growth form, record the
<em>host</em> species.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>habit</em>, selecting all terms that apply to the
species (<a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>phenology</em>, selecting all attributes relevant
the specimen (<a href="#appendix-3">Appendix 3</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>If required, take a <em>photo</em> of the specimen or an
individual from within the plot by pressing the <em>camera</em> button.
This can be a useful reference for unfamiliar species for the remainder
of the survey. Use a photo reference scale in each photo (see Appendix
4). Record a <em>comment</em> of the photo if required. Take multiple
photos if required.</p></li>
<li><p>If collecting plant tissue vouchers, press the <em>plant tissue
voucher</em> button to navigate to the Plant Tissue Vouchering Module.
Once the associated plant tissue voucher barcode label is scanned into
the app, return to the and Enhanced protocol in the Floristics
Module.</p></li>
<li><p>Press the <em>save species record</em> button to save the current
species record.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the plant specimen voucher into a field press for long-term
storage and drying (Figure 2). Use one folded tabloid-sized newspaper
sheet for each specimen and use corrugated cardboard dividers frequently
(at least one cardboard between every fifth specimen or more frequently
for bulky specimens).</p></li>
<li><p>Press the <em>add another species</em> button to begin recording
another species record and repeat steps 7–16.</p></li>
<li><p>Once all species have been recorded and their voucher barcode
scanned, press the <em>finish protocol</em> button to return to the
module selection screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Close the field press and tighten the straps. Label the plant
press using a permanent marker on the top sheet of cardboard with the
<em>plot number</em> and <em>date</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Inspect the field press every 2–3 days during the field survey
and replace newspaper when necessary.</p>
