    <h1 id="module-overview">Module overview</h1>
<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols</h2>
<p>This module includes two protocols to record flora species
composition within a core monitoring plot:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/35175f0d-bdd7-4e32-908f-17f7239e78fa">Enhanced protocol</a> – plant specimen vouchers collected for all
species present in a plot for identification by the relevant herbarium
(or approved taxonomist).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/bc2ba93e-43f9-425f-83cd-bbf5c422bdf8">Standard protocol</a> – plant specimen vouchers collected for a
subset of the species (new, unknown, important, contentious and
threatened species; see <a href="#key-definitions-and-terminology">Table 1</a>) present in a plot for identification by
the relevant herbarium (or approved taxonomist). Field botanist
identification and plant photo vouchers collected for the remaining
species.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The enhanced protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for
collecting vouchers of all flora species from a plot, attaching voucher
barcode labels, scanning the voucher barcodes into the Monitor app,
allocating the species growth form and field name, pressing the
vouchers, and maintaining the pressed vouchers both during and after the
field survey. The guidelines provide further information on taxonomic
preferences and pressing techniques, including specifics for dealing
with small species, succulent species and wet specimens.</p>
<p>The enhanced protocol is best practice and recommended, particularly
for baseline surveys and inexperienced surveyors, as vouchers are
provided to the relevant herbarium (or approved taxonomist) for
identification. The Enhanced protocol is highly recommended when a plot
is monitored for the first time and, for more arid environments, when a
plot is monitored after favourable environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The standard protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for
collecting vouchers of the subset of the flora species from a plot,
attaching voucher barcode labels, scanning voucher barcodes into the
Monitor app or entering species into the app if they have already been
vouchered from the project area, allocating the species growth form and
taking plant photo vouchers (in-ground habit and close-ups of key
distinguishing features). The guidelines provide further information on
identifying species using keys, flora reference guides and local
herbarium collections, and photography techniques, including specifics
for photographing key distinguishing features to assist in
identification.</p>
<p>The standard protocol may be suitable for use by experienced field
botanists that are able to confidently identify flora species in their
region, or during a plot revisit where plant specimen vouchers have been
previously collected and identified. This is intended to reduce survey
time for experienced field botanists or during plot revisits, while
ensuring a reference to verify any disputed field identifications. If
any of the field identifications are disputed, there is at least one
plant specimen voucher and plant photo vouchers for verification by
taxonomic experts from herbaria or other expert opinions that may be
sought.</p>

    <h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>
  Flora species composition is an integral component of ecological assessments
  as it provides a direct measure of the flora species diversity present in a
  given area at a given time. It is also a measurement required for the study,
  reporting and management of biodiversity change, making it an essential
  variable for any ecological monitoring program (Pereira <em>et al.</em> 2013).
  Flora species composition is a major factor in the analysis of plot data
  (Brocklehurst <em>et al.</em> 2007). It can be used to inform on survey
  conditions (e.g. presence or absence of annual and ephemeral species,
  flowering phenology, germination, species condition), and allows for the
  spatial and temporal analysis of the presence-absence of flora species within
  and among plots (Baruch <em>et al.</em> 2018). This includes species of
  conservation significance and significant weeds, and this information is
  particularly informative for development assessments aiming to avoid impacts
  to, and conservation programs aiming to improve habitat for species of
  conservation significance or important populations (Monks
  <em>et al.</em> 2019).
</p>
<p>
  Flora species composition can provide information about a range of different
  factors, making it both fundamental and of high importance to assessing
  vegetation conditions. The presence and persistence of a flora species or a
  group of species reflects the presence or recent presence of conditions that
  favour such species (Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009). Flora species composition
  is also linked to parameters such as soil type (van der Ent
  <em>et al.</em> 2015), soil properties (e.g. electrical conductivity, pH,
  nutrients; Gibson <em>et al.</em> 2004; Lyons <em>et al.</em> 2004).,
  ecosystem processes (e.g. nutrient cycling; Ehrenfeld 2003), microclimate
  (e.g. soil temperature; Smith and Johnson 2004), plant-plant interactions
  (e.g. competition; Belsky 1992), and fauna-flora interactions (e.g. grazing,
  pollination; Andrew and Lange 1986; Scaccabarozzi <em>et al.</em> 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Flora voucher specimens are routinely collected to support floristic data
  collected during ecological surveys (e.g. Biological Survey of South
  Australia; Heard and Channon 1997) and research projects (e.g. genetic
  analysis of a taxon; Liu <em>et al.</em> 2020). They are crucial to
  authenticate the taxonomy of a species (Culley 2013). Field identifications
  are prone to error (Scott and Hallam 2003; Lacerda and Nimmo 2010), and
  collecting vouchers to be expertly identified by herbarium botanists ensures
  that flora species composition is measured correctly and consistently (Sparrow
  <em>et al.</em> 2020). Flora vouchers are also a tool for identifying
  localities of a taxon (Feeley 2012) and undertaking taxonomic revisions. Flora
  species classification is constantly changing and shifts in species alignments
  and groupings are made as new evidence comes to light (Craven
  <em>et al.</em> 2004; Maslin and Reid 2012). Identifications are subject to
  change and voucher specimens help cross-reference these changes to previous
  research.
</p>
<p>
  Flora vouchers are widely used for purposes other than taxonomy, including in
  genetic, ecological and environmental studies (Culley 2013). Vouchers allow
  for genetic comparisons to examine spatial and temporal genetic variation and
  processes such as genetic bottlenecks (Cozzolino <em>et al.</em> 2007;
  Dormontt <em>et al.</em> 2014). They are useful in studies of the impacts of
  climate change on flora, including to track shifts in species distributions,
  flowering times and stomatal density (Woodward 1987; Feeley 2012; Calinger
  <em>et al.</em>
  2013), and can be used to identify conservation priorities (MacDougall
  <em>et al.</em> 1998). Opportunities also exist to advance DNA barcoding of
  plants by building DNA barcode databases using flora vouchers (Dormontt
  <em>et al.</em> 2018).
</p>
<p>
  The use of photographs to complement herbarium voucher specimens is not a new
  concept (Funk <em>et al.</em> 2017; Gómez-Bellver <em>et al.</em> 2019).
  Usually such photographs provide a record of details that cannot be preserved
  in dried specimens that are critical for species identification (e.g. flower
  shape and/or colour; LaFrankie Jr and Chua 2015), or illustrate the habitat
  where the specimens were collected (Gómez-Bellver <em>et al.</em> 2019). There
  are several advantages of photo vouchers, including the preservation of the
  colour and shape of features, all features can be recorded, they are
  long-lasting and can be readily duplicated without limit, storage and curation
  is straightforward and affordable, and damage to plants is minimised
  (LaFrankie Jr and Chua 2015).
</p>
    """^^rdf:HTML ;
    tern:scope """<h1 id="introduction">Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>Floristics is the study of the flora species present within a
specific geographical area. In the Floristics Module, all native and
introduced vascular flora species within a core monitoring plot are
identified (to the species level wherever possible and the subspecies
level if relevant). Flora species composition is recorded in the form of
a species list or inventory (Hnatiuk <em>et al.</em> 2009), and this
forms the basis of the fundamental collection of growth form (e.g. forb,
grass, shrub, tree) and cover of all flora species within the plot (NERP
National Condition Working Group 2015). Flora species composition is
also essential to vegetation classification and mapping (see the
Vegetation mapping module; McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2008; Hnatiuk <em>et
al.</em> 2009).</p>
<p>The Floristics Module involves the collection of plant specimen
vouchers of all species to support the species list recorded. Plant
specimen vouchers ensure correct species identification, provide a
taxonomic reference and ensure the repeatability of studies. Plant
specimen vouchers are collected and preserved appropriately in the field
using a plant press (see <a href="#key-definitions-and-terminology">Table 1</a>), and later identified by taxonomic
experts (Heard and Channon 1997; Culley 2013; Sparrow <em>et al.</em>
2020).</p>
<p>A plant specimen voucher consists of a pressed and dried specimen of
an individual, containing aboveground structures (leaves, stems, bark,
flowers, fruits, seeds) and below-ground structures (roots, rhizomes)
when possible. When lodged in herbaria, specimens are usually mounted
onto acid-free paper, although depending on the type of specimen, they
may be stored in a box, packet or jar under controlled environmental
conditions (Culley 2013). See the TERN Vascular Plant Collection
Guidelines and Plant Specimen Mounting Guidelines for further details
(TERN 2023b, 2023a).</p>
<p>Assigned field names (linked to voucher barcode labels) are the
primary key for subsequent data collection for that species within a
visit, ensuring consistent nomenclature. Plant specimen vouchers are
intended to be identified by herbarium botanists (or approved
taxonomists). A subset of specimens may be included in the respective
local herbaria at the discretion of individual herbaria and subject to
the standards prescribed by each institution. Tracking of plant specimen
vouchers is of vital importance. Therefore, adhesive voucher barcode
labels that can be scanned by mobile device software directly into the
app are used.</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
