Protocol</h1>
<h2 id="field-collection">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plot must be established using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout
Module</a> prior to the conducting the Within-plot belt transect
protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> must be completed prior to, or during
the reconnaissance visit.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey activity time estimates will vary depending on the number and
variety of signs encountered, the number of measures recorded, and if
scats are being collected and removed or merely recorded. As a general
guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1–2 hours hour for survey planning.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20–60 minutes to complete the reconnaissance visit and
transect set-up.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 15 minutes for the survey set-up before commencing each
survey to enter the information.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 30–60 minutes per 100 m of transect. The time estimate
varies depending on the frequency and variety of signs, the number of
measures recorded, and if scats are being collected and removed or only
recorded.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Personnel number and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Within-plot belt transects are best conducted with two personnel,
one making the observations and one recording the data directly into the
app. The second person may also assist with identifying signs
observed.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor making the observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying the characteristic identifiable features of
the target species signs and how to distinguish these signs from other
species. If surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to
practising, using field reference guides, and seeking advice before
conducting this protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Within-plot belt transects do not involve interference with
wildlife. Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals
are unlikely to be required but remember to always check with your local
authority. Access permissions are required.</p></li>

    skos:note """<h3 id="additional-guidelines-1">Additional Guidelines</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="pre-survey-planning-2">Pre-survey
planning</h4>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="transect-length">Transect length</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>There is no limitation to the length of transects. However,
transect lengths are typically restricted to personnel resources,
logistics of completing the surveys, and the window of opportunity to
survey under the same weather conditions. As a guide, transects should
be a minimum of 1 km in length.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="quadrat-dimensions-and-surveyor-workflow">Quadrat dimensions and
surveyor workflow</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Optimal quadrat size depends on the terrain, substrate,
vegetation cover, and the number of pest signs being recorded per
quadrat, and for data recording ease, the number of observers searching
for signs. Assuming the quadrat is searched by one observer spotting the
signs and one person completing the data entry, the recommended width
should be 1-2 m and not exceed 4 m. It is recommended that one observer
walks on the outer edge (i.e. 4 m) from the transect tape, and walks
parallel to the tape and only looking for signs that are within the
quadrat, i.e. between them and the tape. The other person completing the
data entry should walk along the tape, reading the tape to identify the
end of each quadrat length. Quadrat length should be between 1 m and 20
m.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="weather-conditions-1">Weather conditions</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Surveys should only be conducted in good weather conditions, when
temperature, wind and rainfall are typical for the season. Poor weather
conditions will impact both animal movement, and chance of detection
through tracking. If conditions are less than optimal conditions, such
as significantly cooler/hotter/windier/wetter than expected, the survey
should be rescheduled. Wind is a particularly important factor when
detecting tracks of animals in sandy environments, therefore if it is
windier than a fresh wind (Beaufort scale 5, when small trees begin to
sway) the morning of the survey, consider rescheduling.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="repeat-surveys-1">Repeat surveys</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>There is no rule for when to repeat surveys. Surveys should be
conducted as often as the project requires, i.e. weekly, monthly,
bi-monthly, quarterly. For consistency, aim to replicate the conditions,
i.e. similar weather, similar time, moon phase, observers, and reference
materials.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="field-survey-1">Field survey</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Observers should remain consistent throughout the duration of the
survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Surveys should be conducted for a minimum of 3 consecutive days
(Cowled and Lapidge 2004, Mitchell and Balogh 2007b).</p></li>
<li><p>Where the species cannot be determined, provide as much
information as possible (e.g., carnivore, herbivore, hoofed, deer,
etc.). Remember to take representative photos of the signs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="weather-conditions-2">Weather conditions</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Weather conditions should be recorded at least once per day, but
can be recorded multiple times, if weather conditions change.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are not using a weather station or temperature gauge, use
the Bureau of Meteorology website (or other weather apps) to estimate
the temperature at the time of the survey for the closest weather
station (data can be checked with the closest weather station after the
survey if needed).</p></li>
<li><p>Moon phase is recorded as it plays an important role in how
bright the night sky is, and therefore can impact animal activity and
movement. Either observe the moon or use the Bureau of Meteorology
website (or other weather apps) to determine the moon phase for the date
of the survey.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="tracks-1">Tracks</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Tracks are generally easiest to identify where the ground is soft
enough to allow imprinting, including muddy or sandy sites, such as
creek and dam banks, claypans, beaches and dried puddles, as well as
roadside dust (Triggs 1996).</p></li>
<li><p>The best tracks are found early in the morning and are easiest to
observe with the shadow behind the observer (Triggs 1996, Moseby et al.
2009).</p></li>
<li><p>Walk into the sun when recording tracks to optimise shadows (Arid
Zone Monitoring 2021).</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t depend on a single print for identification of a species,
look at multiple gaits of an animal and follow it until you are certain
of your identification (Southgate and Moseby 2008).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="scat-counts-and-collection-1">Scat counts and
collection</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Scats can either be recorded as present/absent or counted within
each quadrat (optional).</p></li>
<li><p>Scats can be left in situ or removed during the survey to allow
for a faecal accumulation rate to be calculated on future surveys
(optional) (Engeman et al. 2013) (Engeman et al. 2013, Ferretti et al.
2015).</p></li>
<li><p>If scats are removed they should be picked up by hand (gloves are
recommended), bagged and moved away from the transect line or any other
transect lines that are being surveyed or may be surveyed in the future.
Scats can be moved to the outer edge of the plot away from other
transect lines. Do not create excessive disturbance by raking or
sweeping the scats.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="warren-and-den-counts-1">Warren and den
counts </h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Warrens and dens are recorded as being present, and active or
in-active entrances within each quadrat are recorded (optional). There
is no need to count the number of entrances in each quadrat, or note
each entrance's active or in-active status.</p></li>
<li><p>Active burrows have an entrance that is not blocked by spiderwebs
or vegetation, usually with tracks, scrapings and/or scats at the
entrance. Some animals have burrow systems with multiple entrances, some
freshly used and others older, so if you find a burrow that looks
unused, check nearby for active entrances (Threatened Species Recovery
Hub undated).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="aging-signs-1">Aging signs </h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Very fresh tracks on good tracking surfaces are usually very
clear, with small features like claws and footpads visible. Check tracks
from very small animals (insects and mice), which are only clear for a
day or two, and compare these with older tracks. If the tracks of
insects can be seen passing over the track you are trying to identify,
then you know your track is older than a couple of days. With time, the
fine features of tracks disappear, and only the general gait is
visible.</p></li>
<li><p>As scats age, they become drier, lighter in colour, and get
harder and less smelly. Very old scats are crumbly and do not
smell.</p></li>
