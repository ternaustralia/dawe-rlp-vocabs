<h3 id="pre-requisites-2">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plot must be established using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout
Module</a> prior to, or during the reconnaissance survey of the Active plot
search protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> must be completed prior to, or during
the reconnaissance survey the Active search protocol.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-2">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey activity time estimates will vary depending on the number and
variety of signs encountered, the number of measures recorded, and if
scats are being collected and removed or merely recorded. As a general
guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1–2 hours hour for survey planning.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20–60 minutes per plot to complete the reconnaissance visit
and set up the plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 15 minutes for the survey set-up before commencing each
survey to enter the information.</p></li>
<li><p>For 1 ha plots, allow a minimum of 60 minutes of survey effort
per plot (i.e., 30 minutes for two observers).</p></li>
<li><p>For 2 ha plots, allow a minimum of 2 hours of survey effort per
plot (i.e., 60 minutes for two observers).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-2">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Personnel number and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Within-plot belt transects are best conducted with two personnel,
one making the observations and one recording the data directly into the
app.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor making the observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying the characteristic identifiable features of
the target species signs and how to distinguish these signs from other
species. If surveyors are not confident, time should be dedicated to
practising, using field reference guides, and seeking advice before
conducting this protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Within-plot belt transects do not involve interference with
wildlife. Therefore scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are
unlikely to be required, but remember to always check with your local
authority. Access permissions are required.</p></li>

    skos:note """<h3 id="additional-guidelines-2">Additional Guidelines</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="pre-survey-planning-3">Pre-survey
planning</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Plot sign searches can be conducted at core 1 ha plots (where
other modules have been completed), at fauna plots (where other fauna
based modules have been completed), or at 2 ha biodiversity plots
(combining both core and fauna plots for a total of 2 ha), however
consideration needs to be given to the timing of the surveys. Activity
should be minimised immediately prior and during a trapping survey to
reduce disturbance.</p></li>
<li><p>Assess the overall survey location to ensure that the substrate
offers a suitable tracking surface across a broad area for detecting
tracks and other signs (soft sand, not too much vegetation, soil crust
or leaf litter). Plots not meeting these criteria should not be surveyed
using the Plot sign search protocol, and the signs Within-plot belt
transect protocol is more appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>Plots where sign searches are conducted should be a minimum of 4
km apart.</p></li>
<li><p>If an associated road transect is also surveyed, it should be
100 m in length. A 100 m measuring tape can be used or it can be defined
using the app. A 100 m transect is used, irrespective of plot size (i.e.
same for 2 ha and 1 ha plots).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="optional-nearby-track-plots">Optional nearby
track plots</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>The inclusion of the optional survey component to establish and
survey a section of track near the track plot is aimed to maximise the
detection and recording of pest fauna (and all fauna) tracks. Vehicle
tracks, particularly if consisting of sand or soft gravels, offer the
opportunity to record animal tracks readily. Animal tracks overlain
vehicle tracks can indicate recent presence. In addition, vehicle tracks
can be swept the day prior to indicate recent presence. If surveying of
vehicle tracks is considered important and beneficial to the training of
personnel, and yields good results, consider implementing the Track plot
protocol. </p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="weather-conditions-3">Weather conditions</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Surveys should only be conducted in good weather conditions, when
temperature, wind and rainfall are typical for the season. Poor weather
conditions will impact both animal movement, and chance of detection
through tracking. If conditions are less than optimal conditions, such
as significantly cooler/hotter/windier/wetter than expected, the survey
should be rescheduled. Wind is a particularly important factor when
detecting tracks of animals in sandy environments, therefore if it is
windier than a fresh wind (Beaufort scale 5, when small trees begin to
sway) the morning of the survey, consider rescheduling.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="repeat-surveys-2">Repeat surveys</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>There is no rule for when to repeat surveys. Surveys should be
conducted as often as the project requires, i.e. weekly, monthly,
bi-monthly, quarterly. For consistency, aim to replicate the conditions,
i.e. similar weather, similar time, moon phase, observers, and reference
materials.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="field-survey-2">Field survey</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Observers should remain consistent throughout the duration of the
survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Surveys should be conducted for a minimum of 3 consecutive days
(Cowled and Lapidge 2004, Mitchell and Balogh 2007b).</p></li>
<li><p>Where the species cannot be determined, provide as much
information as possible (e.g., carnivore, herbivore, hoofed, deer,
etc.). Remember to take representative photos of the signs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="weather-conditions-4">Weather conditions</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Weather conditions should be recorded at least once per day, but
can be recorded multiple times, if weather conditions change.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are not using a weather station or temperature gauge, use
the Bureau of Meteorology website (or other weather apps) to estimate
the temperature at the time of the survey for the closest weather
station (data can be checked with the closest weather station after the
survey if needed).</p></li>
<li><p>Moon phase is recorded as it plays an important role in how
bright the night sky is, and therefore can impact animal activity and
movement. Either observe the moon or use the Bureau of Meteorology
website (or other weather apps) to determine the moon phase for the date
of the survey.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="tracks-2">Tracks</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Tracks are generally easiest to identify where the ground is soft
enough to allow imprinting, including muddy or sandy sites, such as
creek and dam banks, claypans, beaches and dried puddles, as well as
roadside dust (Triggs 1996).</p></li>
<li><p>The best tracks are found early in the morning and are easiest to
observe with the shadow behind the observer (Triggs 1996, Moseby et al.
2009). </p></li>
<li><p>Walk into the sun when recording tracks to optimise shadows (Arid
Zone Monitoring 2021).</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t depend on a single print for identification of a species,
look at multiple gaits of an animal and follow it until you are certain
of your identification (Southgate and Moseby 2008).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="scat-counts-and-collection-2">Scat counts and
collection</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Scats can either be recorded as present/absent or counted within
each quadrat (optional).</p></li>
<li><p>Scats can be left in situ or removed during the survey to allow
for a faecal accumulation rate to be calculated on future surveys
(optional) (Engeman et al. 2013) (Engeman et al. 2013, Ferretti et al.
2015).</p></li>
<li><p>If scats are removed they should be picked up by hand (gloves are
recommended), bagged and moved away from the transect line or any other
transect lines that are being surveyed or may be surveyed in the future.
Scats can be moved to the outer edge of the plot away from other
transect lines. Do not create excessive disturbance by raking or
sweeping the scats.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="warren-and-den-counts-2">Warren and den
counts </h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Warrens and dens are recorded as being present, and active or
in-active entrances within each quadrat are recorded (optional). There
is no need to count the number of entrances in each quadrat, or note
each entrance's active or in-active status.</p></li>
<li><p>Active burrows have an entrance that is not blocked by spiderwebs
or vegetation, usually with tracks, scrapings and/or scats at the
entrance. Some animals have burrow systems with multiple entrances, some
freshly used and others older, so if you find a burrow that looks
unused, check nearby for active entrances (Threatened Species Recovery
Hub undated).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="aging-signs-2">Aging signs </h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Very fresh tracks on good tracking surfaces are usually very
clear, with small features like claws and footpads visible. Check tracks
from very small animals (insects and mice), which are only clear for a
day or two, and compare these with older tracks. If the tracks of
insects can be seen passing over the track you are trying to identify,
then you know your track is older than a couple of days. With time, the
fine features of tracks disappear, and only the general gait is
visible.</p></li>
<li><p>As scats age, they become drier, lighter in colour, and get
harder and less smelly. Very old scats are crumbly and do not
smell.</p></li>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="reconnaissance-and-survey-set-up-1">Reconnaissance and survey
set-up</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Arrive at the plot prior to the intended survey date. Traverse
the plot to assess vegetation cover, density, and substrate. Assess the
surface condition to ensure areas of bare sand are present and the plot
is not covered in vegetation cover or leaf litter. If the plot does not
have areas suitable for tracking, do not proceed and instead consider
using the Within-plot belt transect protocol.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>If suitable, arrive at the plot on the day of the survey, ideally
early morning or late afternoon.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the Plot Selection and Layout Module has been completed to
mark out the plot boundary and define the current visit in the Monitor
app.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the Standard protocol within the Plot Description Module
has been completed.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the Monitor app and select <em>Sign-based Fauna Survey
Module &gt; Active plot sign search protocol</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Indicate if <em>survey intent</em> is a once-off measure,
repeated measure, repeated measure with previous scat removal, or linked
to a pre-control activity or post-control activity (optional).</p></li>
<li><p>Indicate if a <em>nearby track transect</em> survey will be
conducted after the plot has been completed.</p></li>
<li><p>Indicate the <em>target species</em> for the survey (cat, fox,
wild dog, rabbit, deer species, goat, pig, horse, camel, other).
Multiple species can be selected. If other is selected, enter the pest
species name.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the <em>number of observers</em>, <em>observer name</em>
and <em>observer role</em> (spotter, data entry, data entry only) for
each observer.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the <em>weather conditions</em>, including
<em>temperature</em>, <em>rainfall</em>, <em>rainfall duration, cloud
cover,</em> <em>wind speed</em>, and <em>moon phase</em> of the previous
night. Note the weather conditions can be adjusted after the
survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the <em>tracking surface</em> information including
detectability of the tracking surface type.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify if <em>site information</em> will be completed after the
survey has been conducted or if other modules are being conducted in
unison, whereby site information such as floristics and habitat
condition will be collected elsewhere (refer to guidelines for further
information).</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="conduct-the-survey-2">Conduct the survey
</h4>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li><p>Arrive at the plot and identify the position of the sun. Next,
determine which direction to commence traversing the plot, ideally
walking into the sun to use shadows cast by tracks, and identify which
corner of the plot to start the survey at (either of the 4
corners).</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li><p>Select <em>record start location</em> and select the corner you
are standing at to commence the survey. The app will record the
location, start date and time automatically. For subsequent re-surveys,
make sure the survey starts at the same corner so that start location
photos are the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <em>start location photo</em> and face towards the centre
of the plot to take a representative photo.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <em>start active sign search</em> to commence the timer,
then begin surveying by zig-zagging across the plot looking for signs.
Your position within the plot will be shown, and the app will record a
location every minute until the survey is completed, creating a trail
across the plot. Ensure the entire plot is covered by checking the map
intermittently, even when no signs are observed.</p></li>
<li><p>For each sign observed, select <em>add sign record</em>:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>select the sign type (scat, track, dig, burrow, warren, etc, see
<a href="#appendices">Appendix 1</a>)</p></li>

certain)</p></li>
<li><p>indicate the sign age (fresh 1-2 days, old 3-7 days, very old 7+
days) (optional field)</p></li>
<li><p>indicate the age class of the individual responsible for the sign
(optional field applicable to scats and tracks only based on
size)</p></li>
<li><p>add photo (representative photos should be taken for each
species/sign type for the plot – i.e. not all signs observed need to be
photographed, ideally a scale card should be used in all photos
(optional, up to 3 photos per sign record)</p></li>
<li><p>if warrens, burrows or dens are observed, count and record the
number of entrances and record if any are considered active or not
active (optional)</p></li>
<li><p>add any additional comments in the observation comments field.
Recording the gait length and width may be of interest, particularly of
feral cats and foxes to assist distinguishing individuals.</p></li>

set-up stage (see above). This optional survey component should only be
completed if a suitable section of the nearby vehicle track occurs
within 200 m of the plot just surveyed, and if it safe to survey (i.e.
no expected vehicles).</p>
<ol start="21" type="1">
<li><p>Arrive at the intended section of a nearby track.</p></li>
