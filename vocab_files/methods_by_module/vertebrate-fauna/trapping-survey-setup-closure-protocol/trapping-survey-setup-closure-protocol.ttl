set-up and closure protocols</h1>
<h2 id="field-collection">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before commencing the survey, the fauna plot must be established
using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Layout and Selection Module</a>. This can either be done
during the reconnaissance visit or on the day before installing the
traps.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> must be completed before, during or
immediately after a trapping survey. The enhanced protocol should be
done at least on the first trapping survey, and the standard protocol
should be completed on subsequent visits during different seasons/years.
This module is best completed by personnel familiar with describing the
landforms and vegetation communities.</p></li>
<li><p>Appropriate scientific permits and animal ethics approvals must
be obtained before the Trapping survey set-up and closure protocols can
commence.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements">Time requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow sufficient time for scientific permits and animal ethics
applications to be prepared and approved prior to the intended survey
dates.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 1 - 2 days for survey planning and scheduling.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 2 - 4 hours to complete reconnaissance visits (plus travel
time).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 2 – 6 hours to discuss museum requirements with curation
personnel, including mammal and reptile curation staff.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 1 – 3 days to prepare survey equipment, pack vehicles (and
trailers).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 3 - 6 hours to install and set-up the traps for each plot.
This manual task depends on the ease of digging, density of vegetation,
number and experience of personnel assisting, and the equipment used.
Allow longer if collapsible pitfalls will need to be constructed on
site.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20 – 40 minutes to complete the survey set-up in the
Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20 - 60 minutes per site per trap check session (i.e.
morning and afternoon) to enter check data into the Monitor app, conduct
any maintenance, fix fallen drift fences (does not include time to
removal animals from traps, refer to the Identify, measure and release
protocol).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 1 – 3 hours to close and pack-up the traps on the final
day. This manual task depends on the ease of digging, density of
vegetation, number and experience of personnel assisting, and the
equipment used. Allow longer if collapsible pitfalls will need to be
de-constructed on site.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are mandatory
for the Trapping survey set-up and closure protocols. Personnel must
meet the jurisdictional requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>All components of the Trap set-up and close protocols are best
done with a small team of personnel to share the manual labour workload.
However, a minimum of two can complete the tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>An ecologist, ideally a fauna ecologist, must be involved in the
site selection process and reconnaissance to ensure the plot meets the
requirements and is homogenous with the adjacent core plot.</p></li>
<li><p>The Trapping survey set-up and closure protocols are primarily
labour-intensive, and general labour personnel can complete much of the
work if supervised by an Ecologist to oversee trap positioning.</p></li>

design and construction of pitfall traps and drift fences</h4>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="pitfall-traps-general">Pitfall traps –
general</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure the conditions of scientific permit and animal ethics
approvals are understood and met.</p></li>
<li><p>Chose a pitfall depth and width that best suits the target fauna
species. Ideally pitfalls will be 40 cm deep, and 22 – 29 cm wide (see
below). Keep in mind that species such as hopping mice will generally
need quite deep pitfalls.</p></li>
<li><p>Chose a pitfall type that is available and suits the project
needs, as well as survey logistics. For example, PVC stormwater pipes
can be difficult to transport, and 20 L buckets or temporary plastic
sheets folded into tubes may be a better option.</p></li>
<li><p>Pitfall traps are not baited.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="permanent-pitfalls-left-in-place-between-survey-periods">Permanent
pitfalls – left in place between survey periods</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>There may be specific requirements scientific permit and animal
ethics requirements regarding permanent pitfalls, especially lid
requirements. This may include the need for a screw top lid held in
place with two tek screws.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally, permanent pitfalls should be constructed from PVC
stormwater pipe, and should be a minimum 40 cm deep, and 22 cm – 28 cm
wide in diameter. The bottom of PVC stormwater pipe pitfalls must be
secure to stop animals digging out underneath. A piece of cut flywire
mesh must be secured to the bottom.</p></li>
<li><p>If scientific permits and animal ethics approvals allow 20 L
plastic buckets to be used as permanent pitfalls, keep in mind that the
bucket lids may not be sufficient to seal the permanent pit as they may
become dislodged, damaged over time, or vandalised. Bucket pitfalls
should be filled with soil.</p></li>
<li><p>Once secure, a shallow level of soil should be placed over the
lids so that they are not visible to the public.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="temporary-pitfalls">Temporary pitfalls</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Temporary pitfalls must be removed at the conclusion of the
trapping session.</p></li>
<li><p>Bucket pitfalls are typically 20 L plastic buckets and are
generally 40 cm deep and 28 – 28.5 cm wide in diameter.</p></li>
<li><p>Temporary collapsible pitfalls are constructed from plastic
sheets, and when rolled to form a tube they should form a pitfall a
minimum 40 cm deep and 22 – 28.5 cm wide in diameter. Collapsible
pitfalls have the advantage in that they can be transported flat and
constructed in the field. A piece of aluminium fly-wire mesh is secured
to one end with tape (or strong elastic bands), and if necessary (and
depending on the width and strength of the side plastic strip), an
additional piece of tape may be required half way up the
pitfall.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="drift-fences">Drift fences</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Drift fences are erected using a ~60 m roll of flywire, ideally
aluminium but fibreglass may be used, ~50 cm wide, to stand 30 – 40 cm
high with ~5-10 cm buried underground (see <a href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Drift fences are held up-right with pins, typically metal wires
partially folded over. The number of pins required per drift fence will
vary depending on the material of the drift fence, soil substrate and
experience of the personnel installing the fence.</p></li>
<li><p>If a hard substrate is encountered when installing pitfalls, and
digging the hole is slow and overly time-consuming, pits can be cut to a
shorter size, or soil can be mounded up around them to enable the top to
be flush with the top of the soil surface.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure-4" id="figure-4" height="400" src="https://w3id.org/tern/static/dawe-rlp/latest/vertebrate/Fig.4.jpg" width="500"/></p>
<p><span class="anchor"></span><h4>Figure 4. Pitfall (20 L
bucket) buried flush to ground level, with drift fence and pin.</h4></p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="trap-design-and-construction-of-funnel-traps">Trap design and
construction of funnel traps</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Funnel traps are collapsible traps constructed from shade cloth
with an internal spring wire frame to maintain shape when open. Funnels
are typically ~75 cm long x 18 cm wide x 18 cm high. A ~4 cm wide
entrance is located at either end enabling animals to enter the trap. A
zip is located along the top of the trap enabling surveyors to empty the
trap.</p></li>
<li><p>Funnel traps are relatively light and will easily blow away.
Ensure funnels are anchored to the ground by placing a pin either side
of the pair wedging them together, or through the flip hook at one
end.</p></li>
<li><p>Although made from shade cloth, additional protection from the
sun must be placed over the funnel trap. A hessian bag (or similar)
should be placed over the funnel trap pair, with pins in place to ensure
the bag does not blow away.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not necessary to bait funnel traps.</p></li>
<li><p>When placing funnels along the drift fence, ensure the funnel is
placed flush against the drift fence, ensuring animals cannot move
between the fence and the funnel (see <a href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Take care when removing animals (particularly snakes) from inside
the funnel trap, ensuring the internal wires and fishing lines are not
damaged (<a href="#figure-5">Figure 5</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure to check the funnels carefully as small reptiles can
easily hide in the folds of the shade cloth.</p></li>
<li><p>When placing funnels in position, extra soil can be placed in
front of the entrance, providing a ramp of soil substrate up to the
entrance hole.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain funnel traps and wipe the zipper clear of soil and leaf
material.</p></li>
</ul><p><img alt="Figure-5" id="figure-5" height="500" src="https://w3id.org/tern/static/dawe-rlp/latest/vertebrate/Fig.5.png" width="400"/></p>
<p><span class="anchor"></span><h4>Figure 5. Pair of
funnel traps positioned along the drift fence showing poor funnel
placement.</h4></p>
<p>Note: The funnel on the left shows poor placement. The gap between
the funnel and the drift fence enables animals to pass rather than
direct them into the funnel entrance. The funnel on the right shows
correct placement, with the funnel flush against the drift fence, and a
smooth soil layer helping direct the animal into the funnel
entrance.</p>

<h5 class="unnumbered" id="trap-design-and-construction-of-box-traps">Trap design and
construction of box traps</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>20 folding box traps with a treadle release mechanism are used at
each site. Elliott traps made by Elliott Scientific (Upwey, Victoria)
are recommended (Elliott size A), 33 cm long, 10 cm high, 9 cm wide),
however similar traps by alternative manufactures may be used.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure scientific permit and animal ethics requirements are
understood and met. If cool overnight weather is expected, a small piece
of insulation should be placed inside all box traps, ensuring it does
not impede the trip plate mechanism. If overnight rain is expected in
addition to cool temperatures (&lt;10<sup>o</sup>C) consider partially
wrapping the box trap in plastic to minimise seepage.</p></li>
<li><p>Box traps should be micro-sited, selecting a location that is
protected by some cover (i.e., next to a shrub). Box traps should be
placed amongst or alongside natural cover, i.e., under or alongside
shrubs, to aid protection from direct sunlight. If the weather is hot,
and traps are closed during the day, place traps ideally amongst cover
or at best on the western side of shrubs to limit direct morning
sunlight. If shade from the available cover is limited, consider placing
hessian bags over each trap.</p></li>
<li><p>Take care to identify and avoid potential ant nest locations or
areas of high activity. This may mean moving the trap several metres
from the ideal the trap line alignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Box traps must be placed on flat ground to ensure the bait does
not roll under the mechanism. If a flat position cannot be located,
ensure the front of the trap is higher than the back (i.e., so the bait
rolls back away from the mechanism). Clear debris from under the trap to
ensure stability.</p></li>
<li><p>Flag the location of the Elliott trap with flagging tape to aid
finding it, ensuring the flag is clearly visible, particularly from the
angle of which it will be approached during trap checking. A good
technique is to double flag (2 strips of flagging tape, ~20 cm apart)
the start and end of each trap line, providing a quick visual cue for
the surveyor.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="trap-design-and-construction-of-cage-traps">Trap design and
construction of cage traps</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Cage traps are typically constructed from galvanised wire mesh
and ~56 cm long x 20 cm x 20 cm, but larger cages may be used. Ensure
the trap specifics, including the trip mechanism (foot plate, or hook
mechanism) are recorded in the app. Other trap specifics can be noted in
the comments section (this could include door position of
cages).</p></li>
<li><p>Cage traps must be partially covered with a hessian bag or placed
amongst dense vegetation to provide protection from the sun and
wind.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="standard-bait-for-box-and-cage-traps">Standard bait for box and cage
traps</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Box and cage traps are baited, typically with a small ball
(roughly 1-2 cm in diameter) of standard mammal bait consisting of
rolled oats and peanut butter. Other ingredients, such as honey, vanilla
essence, sardines, tuna and/or cat biscuits, may be added depending on
the target fauna species. Ensure bait type is recorded in the
app.</p></li>
<li><p>Box and cage traps are baited with a small ball (roughly 15 mm in
diameter) of standard mammal bait consisting of rolled oats and peanut
butter. Other additional ingredients often added to the bait mixture,
including honey, vanilla essence, sardines, tuna and/or cat biscuits,
are not recommended and must be noted if they are used.</p></li>
<li><p>Bait should be replaced as needed when depleted. There is no need
to replace bait with fresh bait daily (or every second day) as a scent
attractant if there is enough bait to feed the captured animal
overnight. If bait remnants are removed from the trap, ensure they are
removed from the plot or placed inside a pitfall to avoid attracting
animals to areas other than the trap location.</p></li>
<li><p>When setting the box traps and cages care must be taken to ensure
the bait does not impede the plate mechanism, thus rendering the trap
useless for capturing animals. Ensure twigs and leaf litter are not
impeding closure of the door.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="trapping-commencement">Trapping
commencement</h4>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="consecutive-nights">Consecutive nights</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Each site is trapped for five (minimum) to seven (recommended)
consecutive nights. The duration of the survey is dependent on
logistical considerations. If five nights are planned, but the weather
is less than optimal, consider extending for the additional
nights.</p></li>
<li><p>Trapping can commence either in the morning or afternoon of the
first day. If set-up in the morning, traps must be checked in the
afternoon or early evening that day.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="delayed-starts">Delayed starts</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Delaying the start of surveys can be useful in some
circumstances, for example if different personnel are on site to
establish the trapping set-up before ecologists arrive, and if multiple
sites are being established at once, before commencing the survey on the
same date.</p></li>
<li><p>Delayed starts may also be beneficial if species known to be
particularly sensitive to disturbance occur in the region, and traps are
best positioned, and left for a few days before setting.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the trap setup date (and time) reflect the date the traps
were installed, and record the <em>trap set status</em> appropriately
(i.e. trap closed, trap closed – wired shut, pitfall closed – lid
secured) and updated once opened for the trapping to commence.</p></li>
<li><p>Check with scientific permits and animal ethics approvals before
assuming delayed starts are permitted.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="trap-type-and-the-number-of-traps-per-trap-station">Trap type and
the number of traps per trap station</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The recommended trap layout has one trap per trap station, except
for funnel traps, where one funnel is placed on either side of the drift
fence line.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of box and cage traps can be increased to two, and
combining trap types, i.e., one box trap and one cage trap, is permitted
but must be recorded in the Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>If no fauna species suitable for requiring cage traps over
smaller box traps (i.e., medium mammals such as bandicoots and possums)
are known to occur in the region, the number of cage traps can be
reduced to aid the logistics of carrying cage traps to and from the
project area.</p></li>
<li><p>Setting two traps in close proximity at the same trap station is
beneficial when fauna is in high abundance, or ‘trap happy’ individuals
are repeatedly being caught, as this gives additional opportunities for
other individuals to also be caught.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="checking-traps">Checking traps</h4>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="general">General</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure scientific permit and animal ethics requirements are
understood and achieved. All traps must be checked at least every 12
hours under normal average weather conditions, or more frequently under
hot/cold/raining conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Traps should be checked in sequence to minimise the risk of
missing a trap, and thus prolonging the time a captured animal is
held.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all surveyors avoid walking through the Core Plot to
access the fauna plot during both the installation, and morning and
afternoon trap checks. All foot traffic must go around the core plot.
This is important to minimise disturbance maintain the integrity of the
Core Plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Take care to assess the possible capture of a snake before
picking up the funnel. If a venous snake is captured, use of a snake
catching hook is recommended to carefully lift it from the funnel
trap.</p></li>
<li><p>All traps must be accounted for at the end of each trap checking
session. Surveyors must ensure that all traps are checked. Use of the
app during all trap checking sessions will assist ensuring all traps are
checked, with the surveyor alerted to any missed data entry and
therefore possible missed traps.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="pitfalls-and-drift-fences">Pitfalls and drift
fences</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure the bottom of the pitfall is checked carefully, this
includes turning over the soil and lifting any refuge material. Some
reptiles, particularly legless lizards and blind snakes are
exceptionally good at burying into the soil and hiding.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove any invertebrates, including spiders, scorpions, ants and
beetles that are often caught in pitfall traps (consider keeping for
invertebrate samples).</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct any maintenance of the drift fence during each trap
checking session, ensuring there are no gaps dug under, or branches
laying across.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="funnels">Funnels</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>After unzipping the funnel ensure the entrance material is lifted
up to check for any small animals hiding, and the entire inside is
searched carefully. Small reptiles, such as <em>Morethia</em> sp.
lizards are easily missed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="box-traps-and-cages">Box traps and cages</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>When checking, both in the morning and afternoon, ensure the
traps are well positioned out of direct sunlight. Re-position if
necessary (and also re-position the flagging tape).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure traps remain in good working order throughout the
survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure traps are checked in sequence. Using the app will assist
ensuring all traps are checked.</p></li>
<li><p>Replenish bait once consumed. Note there is no need to replenish
bait daily. The aim of the bait is to supply any captured animals with
enough food to survive the night in the trap, not to act as a scent
attractant.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="ethical-considerations">Ethical
considerations</h4>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="shelter-and-refuges">Shelter and refuges</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Shelter, such as a handful of leaf litter and either a toilet
roll or section of an egg carton, must be placed inside all pitfalls
(refer to your animal ethics and scientific permit conditions as they
may specify what must be used).</p></li>
<li><p>If cool overnight weather is expected, a small piece of
insulation can be placed inside all pitfalls (refer to your animal
ethics and scientific permit conditions as they may specify what
can/must be used).</p></li>
<li><p>If frog captures are anticipated, or possible (i.e. rainfall
expected in a dry arid environment), a wet sponge (~taking up no more
than ¼ of the pitfall bottom to enable other animals to stay dry) should
be placed inside all pitfalls and re-wet each afternoon.</p></li>
<li><p>All trap deaths must be documented. Ensure the trap type, date,
time, species and any comments relevant to the cause are recorded. This
information will be required for animal ethics and scientific permit
report returns, as well as a specific reporting mechanisms required by
the relevant jurisdiction. Assess the suitability of the carcass for
whole specimen vouchering if permitted.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="weather-conditions-intervals-between-checking-and-trap-closures">Weather
conditions, intervals between checking and trap closures</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>All conditions and guidelines of the animal ethics approval and
scientific permit must be adhered to. The below guidelines are
recommended if animal ethics conditions are not specific.</p></li>
<li><p>During typical normal weather conditions for the location
(&lt;34<sup>o</sup>C without significant rainfall), all traps must be
checked, and animals removed a minimum of twice per day, i.e. every 12
to 14 hours, typically during the morning (within 2 hours of sunrise)
and late afternoon.</p></li>
<li><p>On days of high temperatures (&gt;34<sup>o</sup>C):</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>box traps and cages should be closed during the day (closed
during the morning check and re-opened in the late afternoon), unless
sufficient cover is provided to ensure traps are shaded all day and
temperatures do not exceed 38<sup>o</sup>C</p></li>
<li><p>pitfalls can remain open during hot days &gt;34<sup>o</sup>C, but
must also be checked in the middle of the day as well as the morning and
afternoon checks (i.e., 6-7 am, 12-1 pm, 5-6 pm or similar depending on
sunrise/set times)</p></li>
<li><p>all traps must be checked and cleared (i.e., the last trap
checked) within 3 hours of first light before temperatures have become
warm to hot. Consequently, the survey team should discuss such details
the night before as departure times may need to be earlier than
usual.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>On days of extreme high temperatures
(&gt;38<sup>o</sup>C):</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>box and cage traps must be closed if the forecasted maximum
temperature is expected to reach or exceed 38<sup>o</sup>C, i.e., closed
during the morning check and re-opened late afternoon.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If high rainfall is expected (the definition of high will depend
on the local environment), trapping must cease and all traps closed (or
removed) if high rainfall is expected and there is a risk that traps may
not be checked at the scheduled time due to access
restrictions.</p></li>
<li><p>If low overnight minimum temperatures are expected, all pitfall,
box, cage and funnel traps must have insulation provided to aid animals
maintaining body temperature. If trap deaths occur and thought
attributable to low minimum temperatures, the surveyors must consider
closing all traps until warmer temperatures are experienced.</p></li>
<li><p>If the number of captures is high, and the time taken by the
surveyors to check and clear traps is excessive and resulting in animals
potentially being left in traps for longer than 12 hours, the surveyors
must consider:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>closing some sites and recommencing later and staggering the
number of sites concurrently surveyed</p></li>
<li><p>closing some traps, i.e. box traps and focusing on pitfall and
funnel traps – noting in the app which traps were closed to ensure trap
effort is accurately recorded, as a last resort</p></li>
<li><p>removing animals from the traps and releasing them immediately
without full processing (i.e. recording where possible the species only,
but no other measurements).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="ant-attack">Ant attack</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>If ants are present in high numbers (i.e., attacking the bait or
captured animals) effort must be made to remove the threat and risk of
attack. Firstly, the box traps should be re-positioned to a better
location, such as several metres from the ideal trap line alignment
(remember to re-flag the new location). Application of an insecticide,
such as Baygon and Coopex, may be required. If ant attack or the risk of
ant attack continues, consider closing the trap (ensuring the trap
status is updated in the app).</p></li>

<li><p>priority ecosystems and habitats within the project area</p></li>
<li><p>best-on-offer localities, acting as controls whereby species
composition and abundance should be relatively stable, and any

resource availability, i.e. responses to rainfall</p></li>
<li><p>localities undergoing intervention, whereby species composition
and abundance would be expected to change in response to the management
interventions, i.e. responses to pest management, grazing regimes,
improvements to vegetation structure and composition, improving resource

<li><p>opportunities to maximise the survey effort and efficiently use
personnel and equipment.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Conduct a desktop assessment and review existing information on
fauna species of the project area.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Collate existing information to identify what information is
already available and identify what survey effort has been
conducted.</p></li>
<li><p>Review literature to determine the findings of previous surveys,
what species and habitats are present, identify the preferred habitats
and key resource needs of the species expected and likely to occur in
the project area, and identify appropriate survey methods and survey
timings necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Select areas where fauna plots could be established.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider any existing Core Plots and determine if they are
suitable for establishing an adjacent Fauna Plot, remembering that a
fauna plot needs to be directly adjacent to the Core Plot, and is also
100 x 100 m and 1 ha in area, making a combined 200 x 100 m 2 ha
Biodiversity Plot. Trapping activities must not be undertaken on Core
Plots as they create too much disturbance and will interfere with the
long-term monitoring of the core plot.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Decide on the most appropriate survey design, consider the
trapping options, and determine the survey requirements, the
availability of equipment, and personnel requirements to implement the
survey, including:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>trap details</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>dimensions (width and depth) and construction material of
pitfalls, and pitfall drift fence</p></li>
<li><p>use of temporary or permanent pitfalls</p></li>
<li><p>types of traps to include – by default and unless explicitly not
suitable, box traps, cage traps and funnel traps are recommended in the
standard configuration</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>duration of the survey</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>number of consecutive trap nights, either 5 nights or 7
nights</p></li>
<li><p>number of plots to be surveyed concurrently or
consecutively.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Determine the survey frequency (i.e. twice per year, one per
year, every second year), and the preferred season to survey in (i.e.
autumn, spring, or early summer) depending on the target fauna species.
Check that the intended fauna plot location will be accessible at that
time of year (weather conditions and other access
restrictions).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all jurisdictional scientific permits and licences are
held and appropriate animal ethics approvals have been obtained.
Conditions will need to be clearly understood by all personnel involved
in the survey.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure access permissions from the relevant landholder/land
manager have been obtained.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure suitably experienced field staff and all necessary
equipment is available and operational.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss the intended survey with local museum personnel (i.e.,
this may include both the mammal curator and reptile curator) and ensure
all jurisdictional scientific permit and licence conditions will be met.
This may include the whole animal or tissue vouchering requirement,
which must meet the local museum specifications.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>If vouchering is required, ensure all specifics are understood
and all materials, preservation procedures, voucher labels, equipment,
drugs, permits to carry drugs, and workplace requirements to undertake
such activities are understood and obliged.</p></li>
<li><p>Personnel conducting the survey must be familiar with euthanasia
techniques, have appropriate animal ethics approvals, and be fully
confident that museum specifications can be achieved. This Vertebrate
Fauna Module does not include instructions on euthanasia or preparing
voucher specimens (whole animal or tissue samples).</p></li>
<li><p>If the museum requires vouchering, ensure voucher requests are
understood and make a list for reference during the survey. Make sure to
clearly understand which species are required and which are not
required, and the specific requests are documented (i.e. typically an
adult male and non-breeding female, but curation personnel will be able
to provide instruction).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure personnel responsible for identifying species in the field
are confident of species identifications, including distinguishable
features to tell similar species apart. Discuss with museum curation and
subject matter experts, and view example museum vouchers where
possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p>Schedule the survey, considering optimal environmental conditions
specific to the region to maximise the species detected and capture
rates, optimal weather conditions during the survey, avoiding excessive
heat and cold extremes that would influence animal movements and thus
capture rates, and cause animal ethics issues, phase of the moon, where
possible avoiding full moon where nocturnal animal movements may be
minimised, thus impacting capture rates, and logistical constraints that
may impede access to the area.</p></li>
<li><p>In the days before the intended survey start, assess the weather
forecast to ensure conditions are suitable for the survey duration. If
unfavourable weather conditions are forecasted, post-pone the survey
where possible. A survey conducted in less-than-ideal weather conditions
is not desirable.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="reconnaissance-visit">Reconnaissance
visit</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Arrive at the intended Fauna Plot and traverse the plot to assess
vegetation cover, density, substrate, and signs of fauna. Ensure the
plot is homogenous to the adjacent core plot, with landforms,
vegetation, and similar disturbances.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Confirm the plot is suitable and desirable to conduct a trapping
survey.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Use the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f411e246-6777-42b0-b755-32ca1784780b">Plot Layout and Visit Protocol</a> to establish the Fauna
Plot for the first time. This can be done as part of the reconnaissance
or on the day of survey set-up when traps are installed.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> to describe the plot. Keep in

the landforms and vegetation communities, ideally to species level. This
can be done as part of the reconnaissance or on the day of survey set-up
when traps are installed.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>If planning to survey multiple fauna plots concurrently, travel
to subsequent plots, ensure driving routes and time requirements are

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="survey-set-up">Survey set-up</h4>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="suggested-workflow">Suggested workflow</h5>
<p>The following workflow is recommended:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If not already completed, layout the Fauna Plot using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot
Selection and Layout Module</a> and describe the plot using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot
Description Module</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Locate where the pitfall lines will be installed (see Installing
the pitfalls and drift fence lines below).</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Commence digging the trench where the drift fences for Line B and
Line E will be positioned.</p></li>
<li><p>Dig the location of each pit and install the pitfalls in
place.</p></li>
<li><p>Erect the drift fence.</p></li>
<li><p>Position the funnels in place (see Installing funnel traps
below).</p></li>
<li><p>Position in place the box traps (see Installing the box traps
below).</p></li>
<li><p>Position the cages traps (see Installing cage traps
below)</p></li>
<li><p>Record trap set-up in the Monitor app once all traps are in place
(see Entering the Pitfall Line details in the Monitor app
below).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note the instructions below assume that pitfalls and traps will be
open and set and the time of installation. Once everything is in place,
the last step is to ‘set’ the traps in the Monitor app. The app allows
the traps to be set up and left closed (i.e., the trapping has not
commenced yet) if the survey design prefers traps in place for 1-2 days
prior to setting (further information is provided in the Guidelines
below).</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="installing-the-pitfalls-and-drift-fence-lines">Installing the
pitfalls and drift fence lines</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Once the Fauna Plot has been positioned using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot
    Selection and Layout Module</a>, and the corners and centre point marked, locate
where the two pitfall lines will be positioned.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Pitfall Line A is located 30 m in from the shared (or closest)
boundary and Pitfall Line E is located 70 m in from the shared (or
closest) boundary.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a> shows the trap placements along Line A and Line
B.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Mark where the six pitfalls will be positioned along Pitfall Line
A, taking note of any ant nests or key ant activity areas that need to
be avoided. Ideally, pitfalls should be 8 – 10 m apart. Reposition the
pitfall, or entire line, if necessary. Locations of each pit, and the
start and end of the drift fence will be marked in the Monitor app
later.</p></li>
<li><p>Dig the pitfalls holes, ensuring the holes are deep enough so the
top is level flush with the ground. Leave the soil removed from the hole
to the side (ideally about 0.5 m) so it can be used to fill the hole
after the trapping.</p></li>
<li><p>Using mattocks and shovels, dig in the drift fence trench line to
approximately 10 cm deep, minimising ground disturbance where possible
and avoiding damage to mature shrubs. Ideally, the drift lines should be
straight, but weaving around shrubs, trees, and other natural obstacles
is appropriate. If weaving is required, aim for sweeping bends rather
than tight corners.</p></li>
<li><p>Erect the drift fence by securing the loose end with a pin and
placing it firmly into the ground. Roll the drift line out along the
trench. Ensure the bottom few centimetres are buried in the trench, and
stand the fence up, placing pins as required along the drift fence to
help stand it up.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean up the drift fence area, removing branches and twigs that
may deter animals from moving along the length of the fence.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean up the area immediately adjacent to each pitfall,
flattening soil, removing twigs and rocks, and anything that may deter
funnelling the moving animal into the trap.</p></li>
<li><p>Place a small amount of soil about 1 cm deep (i.e., what was
removed to make way for the pitfall) in the bottom of each
pitfall.</p></li>
<li><p>Place a refuge in the bottom of each pitfall, following the
guidelines below.</p></li>
<li><p>If considered appropriate (i.e., if frogs are expected), place a
sponge the bottom of each pitfall.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat for Pitfall Line E.</p></li>
