<h3 id="pre-requisites-1">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before commencing the survey, the fauna plot must be established
using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout Module</a> and the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> must
have been completed.</p></li>
<li><p>The Trapping survey set-up and closure protocol must have been
completed to set the traps.</p></li>
<li><p>Appropriate scientific permits and animal ethics approvals must
have been obtained before the trapping survey set-up commenced.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-1">Time requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 20 – 60 minutes to check each trapping plot. The duration
is dependent on the number of captures. As a minimum, 20 minutes is
required to check each trap (full plot), enter the check into the
Monitor app, and inspect the drift fences for any maintenance
required.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-1">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are mandatory
for the Trapping survey set-up and closure protocols. Personnel must
meet the jurisdictional requirements and, where necessary, be listed as
nominated personnel approved to conduct trapping surveys.</p></li>
<li><p>All personnel handling animals as part of the Identify, measure
and release protocol must be aware of relevant legislation (including
environmental, animal ethics and workplace health and safety), animal
ethics requirements, particularly familiarity with the <em>Australian
code for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes</em>
(NHNRC, 2013), have current animal ethics training.</p></li>
<li><p>All personnel handling animals or survey equipment must be aware
of hygiene procedures and be familiar with how to temporarily house,
transport, and care for animals in a humane manner.</p></li>
<li><p>The Identify, measure and release protocol is best completed with
at least two people. However, three or four personnel can be beneficial,
especially if each brings a different taxa/species expertise.</p></li>
<li><p>All personnel handling animals must be confident in removing
animals from traps and be experienced in handling terrestrial mammals,
reptiles and frogs to obtain basic measurements.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The personnel responsible for identifying species must be
experienced and competent in identifying terrestrial mammals, reptiles
and frogs, distinguish identifiable features, and use field guides and
taxonomic keys when necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Only personnel trained, experienced and confident in venomous
snake identification and handling should remove snakes from the traps
and handle snakes for morphological measurements and identification.
Personnel handling venomous snakes must not work alone.</p></li>

    <h3 id="additional-guidelines-1">Additional guidelines</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="general-1">General</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Animals should only be handled for as long as it takes to
identify the species, take and record body and weight measurements,
assess reproductive status, photograph, temporarily mark, take a tissue
specimen (if permitted and under museum guidance, not covered in this
module), and find a suitable location for release.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="ethical-considerations-1">Ethical
considerations</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Animals are to be released unharmed at the point of capture
within 24 hours of capture.</p></li>
<li><p>All animals caught in traps should be processed at the point of
capture to minimise the time the animal spends in the trap from capture
to release.</p></li>
<li><p>If necessary, transport animals back to the field station or camp
for processing and identification confirmation. Ensure animals are held
securely in a climate-controlled environment (such as an esky). Slightly
wet the bags of reptiles and frogs.</p></li>
<li><p>If transporting venomous snakes, ensure the bags are held
securely, in at least two tightly knotted calico bags. It is also
recommended the bags and snake are placed in a spare cage trap (for
extra security), and clearly labelled.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="removing-animals-from-the-traps">Removing
animals from the traps</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Experienced fauna ecologists will generally have their own
specific techniques and methods for removing animals from the traps.
There is no right or wrong technique, so long as the animal is not
harmed and the time is minimised.</p></li>
<li><p>When checking the box traps, a closed door is the best indication
that the mechanism has been triggered. Carefully lift the trap up. The
weight of the trap will provide an indication of the potential captor.
Face the door end towards you, and the mechanism end away from you.
Gently tilt the trap so that the door end is higher than the mechanism
end, and slightly push the door downward until you can see
inside.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if the animal is potentially venomous, i.e., is it a
snake? If it is a snake, ensure that the trap is only checked by someone
experienced in snake identification and venomous snake
handling.</p></li>
<li><p>If the animal is not a snake, place a calico bag over the door
end, folding it and holding it firmly in place, tilt the trap upwards to
a vertical position so that the door end is upward, and the mechanism
end downward. This should move the animal to the bottom of the trap.
Quickly, yet carefully tip the trap upside down, maintaining a firm grip
of the calico bag held around the trap. This movement should tip the
animal into the calico bag. The animal may avoid entering the calico bag
by holding onto the sides of the trap. If this occurs, continue to hold
the trap upside down and gently shake the trap until the animal falls
into the bag. Once in the bag, ensure the animal is at the bottom,
change your grip and grab around the centre of the bag. Remove the trap
with one hand and continue holding the calico bag closed in the other
hand. If processing at the point of capture, secure the bag by folding
the first ~10 cm of the bag over a few times, and tying the string
around the bag. Get your measuring equipment, camera etc. out ready for
processing.</p></li>
<li><p>Once processed release the animal in a safe location amongst
suitable refuge, where possible under a shrub that has cover at ground
level, amongst leaf litter. The release location should be at least 15 m
from the pitfall line to reduce the chances of immediate
recapture.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="species-identification">Species
identification</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Discuss with the local museum the recommended field guides,
taxonomic keys, and additional resources to use.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="taking-morphological-measurements">Taking
morphological measurements </h4>
<ul>
<li><p>For medium and/or active animals, it may be easier if one person
is holding the animal, and one person is using the callipers and doing
the measurements. For smaller animals, it is often easier for one person
to be doing both the holding with one hand and measuring with their
other hand. The second person can be entering data into the
app.</p></li>
<li><p>Use callipers for mammals where possible. Clear plastic rulers
may be best for small reptiles and frogs.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the animal is fully stretched and not hunched up when
taking head-body and snout to vent measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>Record body measurements in millimetres not centimetres.</p></li>
<li><p>Only record the sex and reproductive status if confident, if
unsure select unknown.</p></li>
<li><p>Take care when handling animals with pouch young, ensuring that
the young are not dislodged.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="taking-photographs">Taking photographs</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>A series of photographs is recommended for each animal to assist
verification of identifications, and document taxonomic and appearance
differences between populations. If a species identification is changed
during the survey, i.e., a species identified as species x at the start
of the survey is further investigated and realised to in fact be species
y, the photographs can potentially be used to make corrections.</p></li>
<li><p>It is up to the survey coordinator to determine if excessive
photographs are being collected, especially if it proves time consuming
due to high capture rates. The taking the photographs could potentially
cease once all surveyors are certain of all identifications, and little
variation between individuals caught is being observed.</p></li>
<li><p>If photos are not taken using the app, make sure to record
camera/SD card/photo numbers in the app for each record.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a scale card or rule in all photographs is strongly
recommended. Examples are shown in <a href="#figure-11">Figure 11</a> - <a href="#figure-12">Figure 12</a>.</p></li>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="snakes">Snakes</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Only surveyors fully trained in snake handling and who are
confident should attempt to remove snakes from the traps and take
measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>If no confident personnel are present at the time (i.e. checking
traps elsewhere), secure the trap and notify additional personnel that
may be able to check the trap later, discuss timeframe to rendezvous,
and determine if the snake should be held in the trap or released
immediately at the point of capture. If no personnel are available, take
care and open the trap using a long-handled snake pole. Have a second
surveyor available to take photographs from a far and release the animal
without processing.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="hygiene">Hygiene</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Always follow strict hygiene precautions when handling all
animals, and especially frogs, and all animal processing
equipment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="non-target-fauna">Non-target fauna</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Non-target species (i.e., birds) should be identified and
released at the capture site. There is no need to take morphological
measurements.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="releasing-animals">Releasing animals</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Find a suitable location for immediate release within 20 m of the
capture location, ensuring the animal is placed near a shrub or woody
debris for refuge, ensure it is released in the shade where possible,
and that no predators (i.e. birds of prey) are in the vicinity.</p></li>
<li><p>After processing, it may be appropriate to temporarily return the
animal to the calico bag whilst a suitable release location is found, or
if needing to consult with other personnel at the site. When ready,
place the bag into position and gently open it and allow the animal to
depart when ready.</p></li>

<li><p>Select <em>take photo series</em> and follow the prompts to take
a photo of the animal from each angle listed. Include a scale card (or
ruler, calliper) in each photo where possible. The photos will assist to
confirm species identification, individual identification, reproductive
status, and clinical observations of individual condition. Remember to
include photos of any identifiable features of the species (i.e.,
underside of hind-foot for mammals and geckos, front foot for geckos and
frogs, reproductive markings and colouration, pores, sites of parasites
and lesions, and any unusual characteristics.</p></li>
<li><p>If using an alternative camera (i.e., of better resolution than a
tablet), ensure photo numbers are entered into the app, and add the
photos later.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>animal fate</em> and indicate if the animal was
released at point of capture, withheld for observation, withheld for
museum vouchering, or if died as result of trap death or handling
death.</p></li>
