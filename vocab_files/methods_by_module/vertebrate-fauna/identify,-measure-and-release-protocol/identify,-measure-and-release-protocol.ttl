      For recaptures, the app will populate recaptured individuals from the
      current survey session. If the animal is not listed, proceed to record all
      details. If the animal is listed from a previous day(s), release the
      animal (optional, record the animal’s weight, check any pouch young etc.,
      but morphological measurements, or photographs should not necessary).

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For new animals, select the ‘check vouchered list’ button. The app will
      populate a list of whole animal vouchers already taking from your plot and
      project area for that species. If there is a listing, check if the sex and
      age-class have already been vouchered, if so, continue processing the
      individual with the intention of taking measurements and releasing.

  <li>
    <p>
      If the species, and same sex, and age-class, have not been vouchered,
      check the decision tree to determine if the animal should be vouchered. If
      the animal is not to be vouchered continue with step 9 below. If the
      animal is to be vouchered, keep the animal in the capture bag, place a
      piece of masking tape on the bag, and label the bag with the details

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p style="color: orange">General</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Animals should only be handled for as long as it takes to identify the
      species, take and record body and weight measurements, assess reproductive
      status, photograph, temporarily mark, take a tissue specimen, and find a
      suitable location for release.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Ethical considerations</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Animals are to be released unharmed at the point of capture within 24
      hours of capture.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All animals must be released at time of day appropriate to the behaviour
      of the species.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All animals caught in traps should be processed at the point of capture to
      minimise the time the animal spends in the trap from capture to release.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If necessary, transport animals back to the field station or camp for
      processing. Ensure animals are held securely in a climate-controlled
      environment (such as an esky). Slightly wet the bags of reptiles and
      frogs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If transporting venomous snakes, ensure the bags are held securely, in at
      least two tightly knotted calico bags. It is also recommended the bags and
      snake are placed in a spare cage trap (for extra security).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Removing animals from the traps</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Experienced fauna surveyors generally have their own specific techniques
      and methods for removing animals from the traps. There is no right or
      wrong technique, so long as the animal is not harmed and the time is
      minimised.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When checking the Elliott traps, a closed door is the best indication that
      the mechanism has been triggered. Carefully lift the trap up. The weight
      of the trap will provide an indication of the potential captor. Face the
      door end towards you, and the mechanism end away from you. Gently tilt the
      trap so that the door end is higher than the mechanism end, and slightly
      push the door downward until you can see inside.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Determine if the animal is potentially venomous, i.e. is it a snake? If it
      is a snake, ensure that the trap is only checked by someone experienced in
      snake identification and venomous snake handling.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the animal is not a snake, place a calico bag over the door end,
      folding it and holding it firmly in place, tilt the trap upwards to a
      vertical position so that the door end is upward and the mechanism end
      downward. This should move the animal to the bottom of the trap. Quickly,
      yet carefully tip the trap upside down, maintaining a firm grip of the
      calico bag held around the trap. This movement should tip the animal into
      the calico bag. The animal may avoid entering the calico bag by holding
      onto the sides of the trap. If this occurs, continue to hold the trap
      upside down and gently shake the trap until the animal falls into the bag.
      Once in the bag, ensure the animal is at the bottom, change your grip and
      grab around the centre of the bag. Remove the trap with one hand, and
      continue holding the calico bag closed in the other hand. If processing at
      the point of capture, secure the bag by folding the first ~10 cm of the
      bag over a few times, and tying the string around the bag. Get your
      measuring equipment, camera etc. out ready for processing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Capture bags are recommended to use whilst removing animals from the
      traps. For example a small calico bag can be placed over the door end of
      the Elliott trap. The trap can then be held upright (bottom of the trap
      where the animal will be located closest to the ground), the door pushed
      open through the bag, and the trap tipped up swiftly to move the animal
      from the bottom into the bag. The surveyor then uses there other hand to
      hold the animal through the bag, whilst securing the top of the bag
      closed. Similarly, larger calico bags can be used for removing animals
      from cage traps.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once processed (see Section 6 Whole animal and tissue vouchering protocols
      ), release the animal in a safe location amongst suitable refuge, where
      possible under a shrub that has cover at ground level, amongst leaf
      litter. The release location should be at least 15 m from the pitfall line
      to reduce the chances of immediate recapture.

<p style="color: orange">Taking morphological measurements</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      For medium and/or active animals, it may be easier if one person is
      holding the animal, and one person is using the calipers and doing the
      measurements. For smaller animals, it is often easier for one person to be
      doing both the holding with one hand, and measuring with their other hand.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use calipers for mammals where possible. Clear plastic rulers may be best
      for small reptiles and frogs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure the animal is fully stretched and not hunched up when taking
      head-body and snout to vent measurements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Record measurements in millimetres not centimetres.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only record the sex and reproductive status if confident.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take care when handling animals with pouch young, ensuring that the young
      are not dislodged.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Taking photographs</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      A series of photographs is recommended for each animal to assist
      verification of identifications, document taxonomic and appearance
      differences between populations. In the event that a species
      identification is changed during the course of the survey, i.e. a species
      identified as species x at the start of the survey is further investigated
      and realised to in fact be species y, the photographs can potentially be
      used to make corrections.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is up to the survey coordinator to determine if excessive photographs
      are being collected, especially if it proves time consuming due to high
      capture rates. The taking the photographs could potentially cease once all
      surveyors are certain of all identifications, and little variation between
      individuals caught is being observed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If photos are not taken using the app, make sure to record camera/SD
      card/photo numbers in the app for each record.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Using a scale card or rule in all photographs is strongly recommended.
      Examples are shown in Figure 24 - Figure 26.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Only surveyors fully trained in snake handling and who are confident
      should attempt to remove snakes from the traps and take measurements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If no confident personnel are present at the time (i.e., checking traps
      elsewhere), secure the trap and notify additional staff that may be able
      to check the trap later, discuss timeframe to rendezvous, and determine if
      the snake should be held in the trap or released immediately at the point
      of capture. If no personnel are available, take care and open the trap
      using a long-handled snake pole. Have a second surveyor available to take
      photographs from a far and release the animal without processing.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Hygiene</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Always follow strict hygiene precautions when handling all animals, and
      especially frogs. Wash hands before and after, and ensuring hands are well
      rinsed.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Non-target fauna</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Non-target species (i.e., birds) should be identified and released at the
      capture site. There is no need to take morphological measurements.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Releasing animals</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Find a suitable location for immediate release within 20 m of the capture
      location, ensuring the animal is placed near a shrub or woody debris for
      refuge, ensure it is released in the shade where possible, and that no
      predators (i.e. birds of prey) are in the vicinity.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      After processing, it may be appropriate to temporarily return the animal
      to the calico bag whilst a suitable release location is found, or if
      needing to consult with other surveyors at the site. When ready, place the
      bag into position and gently open it and allow the animal to depart when
      ready.
