    dcterms:description """<p>This module covers the procedures and guidelines to establish a fauna plot and record site information and photopoint monitoring and conduct six data collection survey protocols.</p>
<p>The protocols are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fauna plot set-up (plot layout, weather station instalment, and photopoints) (mandatory first step of all surveys)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trapping protocols (optional)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify, measure and release protocols (optional, mandatory if trapping protocols are conducted)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whole animal and tissue vouchering protocols (optional, whole animal and liver vouchering are mandatory if trapping protocols are conducted, toe/ear clip vouchering is optional and if permitting allows)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active diurnal and passive nocturnal observations protocols (optional)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bird survey protocols (optional)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acoustic and ultrasonic protocols (optional).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All seven protocols require establishing a fauna plot in relation to a vegetation plot. Guidance for where to establish the fauna plot is provided in Section 3 Desktop study and pre-survey planning , and Chapter X of this manual.</p>
<p>This module has links to the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plot selection and layout module –</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The vegetation and soils plot should have been laid out (and ideally surveyed) before determining the location of the fauna plot where the vertebrate module is to be conducted (and where the invertebrate module may be conducted).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the vegetation and soils plot has been established and the approximate location of where the fauna plot is to be positioned, conduct either a desktop assessment and/or a reconnaissance visit to ground-truth the available options for best positioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the plot was laid out on a previous survey, the centre post needs to be located before commencing the vertebrate fauna module. A GNSS may be required to assist locating the centre post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunistic observations module – including recording of opportunistic direct sightings of fauna species, and indirect signs of presence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invertebrate fauna module – including use of the fauna plot to conduct various invertebrate survey protocols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Camera trapping module – including the collation of vertebrate fauna diversity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Targeted surveys module – including any additional survey techniques not covered by the protocols set-out in this module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interventions module – including any management actions specific to fauna and provision of fauna refuges and resources (nest boxes, artificial cover, removal of artificial water sources)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Condition – including key attributes of pest vertebrate fauna diversity and abundance, and vertebrate fauna diversity.</p>
</li>

<p>Mandatory:</p>

<p>Active diurnal search: Adds to the inventory species list of the plot, particularly useful for cryptic species not readily captured. Destructive activities, such as pulling bark off trees should be confined to the out-skirts of the plot only (within 10 minutes of the fauna plot boundary). Rocks, raked leaf litter etc., must be put back into place.</p>

<p>Passive nocturnal search: Minimum 60 minutes observer time (ideally 2 observers for 30 minutes) walking the plot or immediately adjacent area. Use of head-torches is recommended over hand-held spotlight to minimise disturbance.</p>
