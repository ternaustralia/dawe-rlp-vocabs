<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Do not conduct the bird surveys if weather conditions are likely to
      compromise the detectability of birds:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          wind velocity exceeds about 10 km/hour (grass, leaves, or twigs
          constantly moving), especially for species that are usually detected
          by soft or high frequency calls
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>rainfall intensity is above a drizzle</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>conditions are misty or foggy</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>temperatures are either well below or above the seasonal average.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Do not use call playback (emitting a bird call from a device encouraging
      the bird species to respond and therefore make its presence known). Call
      playback techniques are only permitted in targeted surveys (and nocturnal
      observations).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Try and configure your survey start location so that you will have the sun
      behind you rather than in front of you. Early morning / late afternoon low
      sun position can make seeing birds difficult, especially colours, and
      particularly in shady habitats.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If multiple observers are completing the survey, make sure they are listed
      in the survey details. Observers must stay in close proximity and work
      together (we recommend staying &lt;10 m apart).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the study area has multiple bird plots in relatively close proximity
      (&lt;1 km), we recommend the plots are simultaneously surveyed by multiple
      surveyors to ensure independence of the observations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record all birds you see or hear, but only record birds you can identify
      to the species level with certainty. Do not record unidentifiable species,
      or ‘little brown birds’. However, if the bird has distinguishing features,
      and you are certain you will be able to get an identification after the
      survey by consulting field guides, field apps, or colleagues, enter a
      field name, and include the description details in the free text comment
      box. At the completion of the survey, records marked with field names only
      will not be submitted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Beware of species that mimic other species, and if you are in close
      proximity to a dwelling etc., do not record captive birds that you may
      hear.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For activity type:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The activity of observations that are flying overhead - over the plot
          (FO) and flying overhead circling (FC) – must be noted as it is
          important that birds flying over but not utilising the plot can be
          excluded from certain analyses
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The remainder activity types, flying within the survey area at strata
          level (FW), resting on a tree (ROT), resting on ground (ROG), resting
          on shrub (ROS), foraging on a tree (FOT), foraging on ground (FOG),
          foraging on shrub (FOS) – are optional and considered useful to
          understand how the birds are utilising the plot, but not mandatory.

      A new record will be made. Tap on the species name to bring up the record
      screen, and edit the fields that need updating. I.e. The original
      observation was of a White-browed babbler that was seen and heard, the new
      observation is the same species, but was only heard, so on the copied
      record, select heard from the ‘observation type’ field, and select save
      record.

      At the conclusion of the 60 minutes, the timer will stop to alert you to
      stop recording any new observations. (note the time can be stopped prior
      to this). Select ‘end bird survey’.

      Please spend just a few minutes checking over your records. Select
      ‘records’. Tidy up any incomplete fields, revise the weather information
      if necessary.

      Optional: add in field notes in the free text field. This may include
      photo reference numbers if applicable.

      Note, taking photos of birds is discouraged during the survey as it can
      mean the observer spends more time trying to get a good photo, rather than
      looking for new birds and collecting valuable data. However, if photos are
      taken, they can be attached to the record. Select the record, and ‘add
      photo’ button, and the app will allow you to select photos from your
      camera roll/device (including linked cloud storage accessible from your
      device).
