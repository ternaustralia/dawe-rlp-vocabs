<h2 id="field-collection-2">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites-2">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before commencing the bird survey, the plot must be established
using the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout Module</a> to record the location of the
plot in the Monitor app. Pegs and star-droppers do not need to be
installed to mark the boundary of a Fauna Plot, but the outer boundary
of the 2 ha plot should be marked with flagging tape to aid as a visual
cue. Marking the plot in the Monitor app, and physically with flagging
tape can either be done during a reconnaissance visit or the day before
conducting the bird survey. It should not be done immediately before the
survey commences to avoid disturbing any birds present. The plot only
needs to be marked once on the first visit to establish the
plot.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> should be completed before, during or
immediately after a bird survey. The enhanced protocol should be done at
least on the first visit of the plot, and the standard protocol
completed on subsequent visits during different seasons/years.</p></li>
<li><p>Appropriate scientific permits and animal ethics approvals must
be obtained before the Trapping survey set-up and closure protocols can
commence.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-2">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey time requirements will vary depending on the location and
habitat complexity of the survey location.</p>
<p>As a general rule:</p>
<p>For a 20 minute 2 ha survey</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 15 minutes to initially set-up the bird survey area (once
off)</p></li>
<li><p>~5 minutes to enter the survey details (surveyor, weather etc)
(each survey)</p></li>
<li><p>20 minutes to conduct a 2 ha, 20 minute survey (each
survey)</p></li>
<li><p>~5-10 minutes to complete notes and ensure all data has been
successfully entered (each survey)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>500 m area search:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>15 minutes to initially set-up the bird survey area (once
off)</p></li>
<li><p>~5 minutes to enter the survey details (surveyor, weather etc)
(each survey)</p></li>
<li><p>~60 minutes to conduct a 500 m area search (survey time is not
restricted, but recommended 60 minutes, ensure time is recorded in the
app)</p></li>
<li><p>~5-10 minutes to complete notes and ensure all data has been
successfully entered (each survey).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-2">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bird surveys are observational in nature, and therefore risk to
disturbing wildlife is low. Scientific permits and wildlife ethics
approvals may not apply, but always check with location jurisdictional
requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The personnel responsible for identifying species must be
experienced and competent in identifying birds, be able to distinguish
identifiable features in both physical appearance and call, and be able
to use field guides when necessary.</p></li>
</ul>

    Survey the Fauna Plot and surrounding area for birds.
    This module serves as a sub-protocol of the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/0771a99f-27f4-4ff7-bf6d-aa70fe22ae51">Vertebrate fauna</a> module. 
    Prior to implementing this protocol, it is essential to thoroughly review the Introduction, Key Definitions and Terminology,
    Rationale, and Module Overview provided in the "<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/0771a99f-27f4-4ff7-bf6d-aa70fe22ae51">Vertebrate fauna</a>" module.
    These sections will provide you with important contextual information and a comprehensive understanding of the protocol.

    skos:note """
    <h3 id="additional-guidelines-2">Additional guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Do not conduct the bird surveys if weather conditions are likely
to compromise the detectability of birds:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>wind velocity exceeds about 10 km/hour (grass, leaves, or twigs
constantly moving), especially for species that are usually detected by
soft or high frequency calls</p></li>
<li><p>rainfall intensity is above a drizzle</p></li>
<li><p>conditions are misty or foggy</p></li>
<li><p>temperatures are either well below or above the seasonal
average.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Do not use call playback (emitting a bird call from a device
encouraging the bird species to respond and therefore make it’s presence
known). Call playback techniques are only permitted in targeted surveys
(and nocturnal observations).</p></li>
<li><p>Try and configure your survey start location so that you will
have the sun behind you rather than in front of you. Early morning /
late afternoon low sun position can make seeing birds difficult,
especially colours, and particularly in shady habitats.</p></li>
<li><p>If multiple observers are completing the survey, make sure they
are listed in the survey details. Observers must stay in close proximity
and work together (we recommend staying &lt;10 m apart).</p></li>
<li><p>If there the study area has multiple bird plots in relatively
close proximity (&lt;1 km), we recommend the plots are simultaneously
surveyed by multiple surveyors to ensure independence of the
observations.</p></li>
<li><p>Record all birds you see or hear, but only record birds you can
identify to the species level with certainty. Do not record
unidentifiable species, or ‘little brown birds’. However, if the bird
has distinguishing features, and you are certain you willl be able to
get to an identification after the survey by consulting field guides,
field apps, or colleagues, enter a field name, and include the
description details in the free text comment box. At the completion of
the survey, records marked with field names only will not be
submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Beware of species that mimic other species, and if you are in
close proximity to a dwelling etc., do not record captive birds that you
may hear.</p></li>
<li><p>For activity type:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The activity of observations that are flying overhead - over the
plot (FO) and flying overhead circling (FC) – must be noted as it is
important that birds flying over but not utilising the plot can be
excluded from certain analyses</p></li>
<li><p>The remainder activity types, flying within the survey area at
strata level (FW), resting on a tree (ROT), resting on ground (ROG),
resting on shrub (ROS), foraging on a tree (FOT), foraging on ground
(FOG), foraging on shrub (FOS) – are optional and considered useful to
understand how the birds are utilising the plot, but not
mandatory.</p></li>

<li><p>Arrive at the Fauna plot location and conduct an assessment to
familiarise with the Biodiversity Plot boundaries. If necessary, flag
the boundaries of the 2 ha survey area, considering the configuration of
the Fauna Plot and Core Plot. It may be useful to flag the corners /
boundary of the survey area as a visual aid, but this is no necessary,
especially if the survey area is already marked in the app.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Open the app and select <em>Vertebrate fauna &gt; Bird survey

<li><p>Enter the <em>number of observers</em>, and for each observer,
enter the <em>observer name</em> and <em>observer role</em> (spotter –
naked eye, spotter – binoculars, data entry, data entry only). Multiple
roles can be selected for each observer, except for <em>data entry
only</em> (this assumes this person is primarily using the app and not
actively spotting), i.e., spotters can be only observing, whilst another
person may be both spotting and entering data. Spotter – binoculars,
does assume the observer is using their naked eyes as well as
binoculars.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the <em>weather conditions</em>, including
<em>temperature</em>, <em>rainfall</em>, <em>duration of rainfall</em>,
<em>cloud cover</em>, and <em>wind speed</em>, and moon phase
(optional). Note the weather conditions can be adjusted at the
