<p>
  Note: if you do remain in the survey area and would like like to add
  additional bird observation records, please use the opportunistic observations
  module of the app.
</p>
<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Do not conduct the bird surveys if weather conditions are likely to
      compromise the detectability of birds:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          wind velocity exceeds about 10 km/hour (grass, leaves, or twigs
          constantly moving), especially for species that are usually detected
          by soft or high frequency calls
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>rainfall intensity is above a drizzle</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>conditions are misty or foggy</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>temperatures are either well below or above the seasonal average.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Do not use call playback (emitting a bird call from a device encouraging
      the bird species to respond and therefore make it’s presence known). Call
      playback techniques are only permitted in targeted surveys (and nocturnal
      observations).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Try and configure your survey start location so that you will have the sun
      behind you rather than in front of you. Early morning / late afternoon low
      sun position can make seeing birds difficult, especially colors, and
      particularly in shady habitats.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If multiple observers are completing the survey, make sure they are listed
      in the survey details. Observers must stay in proximity and work together
      (we recommend staying &lt;10 m apart).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If there the study area has multiple bird plots in relatively proximity
      (&lt;1 km), we recommend the plots are simultaneously surveyed by multiple
      surveyors to ensure independence of the observations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record all birds you see or hear, but only record birds you can identify
      to the species level with certainty. Do not record unidentifiable species,
      or ‘little brown birds’. However, if the bird has distinguishing features,
      and you are certain you will be able to get to an identification after the
      survey by consulting field guides, field apps, or colleagues, enter a
      field name, and include the description details in the free text comment
      box. At the completion of the survey, records marked with field names only
      will not be submitted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Beware of species that mimic other species, and if you are near a dwelling
      etc., do not record captive birds that you may hear.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For activity type:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The activity of observations that are flying overhead - over the plot
          (FO) and flying overhead circling (FC) – must be noted as it is
          important that birds flying over but not utilizing the plot can be
          excluded from certain analyses
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The remainder activity types, flying within the survey area at strata
          level (FW), resting on a tree (ROT), resting on ground (ROG), resting
          on shrub (ROS), foraging on a tree (FOT), foraging on ground (FOG),
          foraging on shrub (FOS) – are optional and considered useful to
          understand how the birds are utilizing the plot, but not mandatory.
        </p>
