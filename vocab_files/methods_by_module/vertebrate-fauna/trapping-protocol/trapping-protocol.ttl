<p>The following workflow is recommended:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Layout the plot.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Layout and install the pitfall lines, and position of each pitfall, and
      commence digging the pits in place.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Layout the drift fence lines and erect the fence.</p></li>
  <li><p>Position the funnels in place.</p></li>
  <li><p>Position in place the Elliott traps.</p></li>
  <li><p>Position the cages traps.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Using the app, set the traps (this is best done once all traps are in
      place).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="color: orange">Installing the pitfalls and drift fence lines</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once the fauna plot has been positioned (see the Fauna plot layout and
      photographs protocols ), and the corners and center point marked, locate
      where the two pitfall lines (full plot), or one pitfall line (half plot)
      will be positioned. See Figure 1 (full plot) and Figure 2 (half plot).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Mark where the six pitfalls will be positioned along the pitfall line(s),
      taking note of any ant nests or key ant activity areas that need to be
      avoided. Reposition the pitfall, or entire line, if necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Dig the pitfalls holes, ensuring the holes are deep enough so that the top
      is level flush with the ground. Leave the soil removed for the hole to the
      side (ideally about 0.5 m to the side) so that it can be placed back to
      fill the hole at the conclusion of the trapping (assuming temporary pits
      are being used).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Using mattocks and shovels, dig in the drift fence trench line, to
      approximately 5 – 10 cm deep, minimising ground disturbance where
      possible, and avoiding damage to mature shrubs. Ideally the drift lines
      should be in a straightly line, but is appropriate to weave around shrubs
      and trees, and other natural obstacles. If weaving is required, aim for
      sweeping bends rather than tight corners.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Erect the drift fence by securing the loose end with a pin and placing it
      firmly into the ground. Roll the drift line out along the trench. Ensure
      bottom the few centimeters are buried in the trench, and stand the fence
      up, placing pins as required along the drift fence to help stand it up.
      Fill-in the trench with the removed soil to help
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Clean up the drift fence area, removing branches and twigs that may deter
      animals moving along the length of the fence.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Clean up the area immediately adjacent each pitfall, flattening soil,
      removing twigs and rocks, and anything that may deter funneling the moving
      animal into the trap.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place a small amount of soil to about 1 cm deep (i.e., what was removed to
      make way for the pitfall) in the bottom of each pitfall.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place a refuge in the bottom of each pitfall, following the guidelines
      below.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If considered appropriate, place a sponge in the bottom of each pitfall.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Repeat for the second pitfall line (if applicable).</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="color: orange">Installing funnel traps</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Position one funnel trap either side of the drift fence, between the first
      and second pitfall.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Drape a hessian bag over the funnel pair to provide protection for any
      animals caught.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place pins alongside each of the funnel traps and the hessian bag to
      ensure they are held secure against the fence.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Position one funnel trap either side of the drift fence, between the fifth
      and sixth pitfall. Drape a hessian bag over the funnel pair. Place pins
      alongside each of the funnel traps and the hessian bag to ensure they are
      held secure against the fence.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="color: orange">Installing Elliott traps</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Locate where the trap line A will start.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place the lid of the Elliott trap box at the start and mark the location
      with flagging tape (2 strips side by side are recommended to clearly
      indicate the start of the line).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Position one Elliott at the first location, ensuring the trap is on level
      ground, in a shaded position, ideally under or amongst a shrub. Avoid ant
      nests and key activity areas.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure no twigs or leaf litter are protruding through the door entrance
      that will obscure the door closing once treadle plate is set-off.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Bait the Elliott trap with a small (15 mm diameter) ball of standard
      mammal bait, ensuring the bait is behind the treadle plate and will not
      roll forward.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Move 10 m forward to the next location, position, bait and flag the
      location. Continue to the end of the line.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      At Elliott 10, flag the location with flagging tape (2 strips side by side
      are recommended to mark the end of the line).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Move to the start of trap line B, and position Elliott 11 in place.
      Continue to the end of the line, placing the last Elliott 20 in place, and
      leaving the empty container at the end of the line.

</p>
<p style="color: orange">Permanent pitfalls</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Permanent pitfalls (those being left at the site between survey periods)
      are constructed from PVC stormwater pipe, and are a minimum 400 mm deep,
      and 220 – 285 mm wide in diameter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check the conditions of your scientific permit and animal ethics approval.
      There may be specific requirements for permanent pitfalls, especially
      around lid requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Permanent pitfalls must have a secure lid, such as a screw top lid held in
      place with two tek screws.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If using 20 L buckets, the bucket lid is not sufficient to seal the
      permanent pit as they may become dislodged, damaged or vandalized.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once secure, a shallow level of soil should be placed over the lids to
      prevent damage to the pit and so that they are not visible to the public.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The bottom of all pitfalls (must be secure to stop animals digging out
      underneath. A piece of cut flywire mesh should be taped securely to the
      bottom.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pitfall traps are not baited.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Temporary pitfalls</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Temporary pitfalls must be removed at the conclusion of the trapping
      session.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Bucket pitfalls are typically 20 L plastic buckets and are generally 400
      mm deep and 280 – 285 mm wide in diameter. Buckets should be considered
      temporary pitfalls, and not left between trapping periods.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Temporary collapsible pitfalls are constructed from plastic sheets, and
      when rolled they should form a pitfall a minimum 400 mm deep and 220 – 285
      mm wide in diameter. Collapsible pitfalls have the advantage in that they
      can be transported flat and constructed in the field. A piece of aluminium
      fly-wire mesh is then secured to one end with tape (or strong elastic
      bands), and if necessary (and depending on the width and strength of the
      side plastic strip), an additional piece of tape may be required halfway
      up the pitfall.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pitfall traps are not baited.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Drift fences</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Drift fences are erected using a 60 m roll of flywire, ideally aluminum
      but fiberglass may be used, ~50 cm wide, to stand 30 – 40 cm high with
      ~5-10 cm buried underground (see Figure).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Drift fences are held up-right with pins, typically metal wires partially
      folded over. The number of pins required per drift fence will vary
      depending on the material of the drift fence, soil substrate and
      experience of the surveyors installing the fence.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The bottom of all pitfalls (permanent and temporary) must be secure to
      stop animals digging out underneath. A piece of cut flywire mesh should be
      taped securely to the bottom.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pitfall traps are not baited.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a hard substrate is encountered when installing pitfalls, and digging
      the hole is slow and overly time-consuming, pits can be cut to a shorter
      size, or soil can be mounded up around them to enable the top to be flush
      with the top of the soil surface. Alternatively, if it impossible to
      install pits to the standardized depth, consider replacing the pitfall
      with a pair of funnel traps. Ensure any discrepancies from the standard
      trap array are recorded.

<p style="color: orange">Trap design and construction of funnel traps</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Funnel traps are collapsible traps constructed from shade cloth with an
      internal spring wire frame to maintain shape when open. Funnels are
      typically ~750 mm long x 180 mm wide x 180 mm wide. A 40 mm wide entrance
      is located at either end enabling animals to enter the trap. A zip is
      located along the top of the trap enabling surveyors to empty the trap.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Funnel traps are relatively light and will easily blow away. Ensure
      funnels are anchored to the ground by placing a pin either side of the
      pair wedging them together, or through the flip hook at one end.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Although made from shade cloth, additional protection from the sun must be
      placed over the funnel trap. A hessian bag (or similar) must be placed
      over the funnel trap pair, with pins in place to ensure the bag does not
      blow away.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not necessary to bait funnel traps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When placing funnels along the drift fence, ensure the funnel is placed
      flush against the drift fence, ensuring animals cannot move between the
      fence and the funnel (see Figure 5).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take care when removing animals (particularly snakes) from inside the
      funnel trap, ensuring the internal wires and fishing lines are not damaged
      (Figure 6).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be sure to check the funnels carefully, as small reptiles can easily hide
      in the folds of the shade cloth.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When placing funnels in position, extra soil can be placed in front of the
      entrance, providing a ramp of soil substrate up to the entrance hole.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Maintain funnel trips and wipe the zipper clear of soil and leaf material.

<p style="color: orange">Trap design and construction of Elliott traps</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      20 folding box traps with a treadle release mechanism are used at each
      site. Elliott traps made by Elliott Scientific (Upwey, Victoria) are
      recommended (Elliott size A), 330 mm long, 100 mm high, 90 mm wide),
      however similar traps by alternative manufactures may be used.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is recommended to set the traps out in numerical order (i.e.
      permanently write numbers of each Elliott’s before going into the field)
      to aid ensuring all traps are checked/closed/removed, and read the number
      you are up to whilst conducting the checks, back-tracking if a number is
      skipped. All traps must be accounted for before completing the site check.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If cool overnight weather is expected, a small piece of insulation must be
      placed inside all Elliott’s, ensuring it does not impede the plate
      mechanism. Suitable insulation could be in the form of a handful of leaf
      litter, a piece of lambs-wool. If overnight rain is expected in addition
      to cool temperatures (&lt;10<sup>o</sup>C) consider partially wrapping the
      Elliott trap in plastic to minimize the animal being soaked.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Elliott’s should be micro-sited, selecting a location that is protected by
      some cover (i.e., next to a shrub).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take care to identify and avoid potential ant nest locations or areas of
      high activity. This may mean moving the trap several meters from the ideal
      the trap line alignment.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Elliott’s must be placed on flat level positions on the ground surface to
      ensure the bait does not roll under the mechanism. If a flat position
      cannot be located, ensure the front of the trap is higher than the back
      (i.e., so the bait rolls back away from the mechanism). Clear debris from
      under the trap to ensure stability.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Elliott’s should be placed amongst or alongside natural cover, i.e., under
      or alongside shrubs, to aid protection from direct sunlight. If the
      weather is hot, and traps are closed during the day, place traps ideally
      amongst cover or at best on the western side of shrubs so that direct
      morning sunlight is limited. If shade from available cover is limited,
      consider placing hessian bags over each Elliott.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Flag the location of the Elliott trap with flagging tape to aid finding
      it, ensuring the flag is clearly visible, particularly from the angle of
      which it will be approached during trap checking. A good technique is to
      double flag (2 strips of flagging tape, ~20 cm apart) the start and end
      Elliott of each line, providing a quick visual cue for the surveyor.
      Additionally, the lid to the Elliott trap box can be left at the start of
      the first line, and the box at the end of the second line.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Trap design and construction of cage traps</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Cage traps are typically constructed from galvanized wire mesh (~560 mm
      long x 200 mm x 200 mm) with a treadle plate release mechanism. Larger
      cages may also be used. Treadle plates are preferred over hook mechanisms
      (typically used for carnivores such as feral cats where meat baits can be
      placed through the hook).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Cage traps must be partially covered with a hessian bag or placed amongst
      dense vegetation to provide protection from the sun and wind.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Checking traps</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      All traps must be checked every 12-14 hours under normal average weather
      conditions, or more frequently under hot/cold/raining conditions, see
      Section 4.1.3.4 Ethical considerations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Traps should be checked in sequence to minimize the risk of missing a
      trap, and thus prolonging the time a captured animal is held.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Standard bait for Elliott and cage traps</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Elliott and cage traps are baited with a small ball (roughly 15 mm in
      diameter) of standard mammal bait consisting of rolled oats and peanut
      butter. Note other additional ingredients often added to bait mixture,
      including honey, vanilla essence, sardines, tuna and/or cat biscuits are
      not recommended, and must be noted if they are used.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Bait should be replaced as needed when depleted. There is no need to
      replace bait with fresh bait daily (or every second day) as a scent
      attractant, as long as there is enough bait to feed the captured animal
      overnight. If bait remnants are removed from the trap, ensure they are
      removed from the site or placed inside a pitfall to avoid attracting
      animals to areas other than the trap location.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When setting the Elliott’s and cages care must be taken to ensure the bait
      does not impede the plate mechanism, thus rendering the trap useless for
      capturing animals. Ensure twigs and leaf litter are not impeding closure
      of the door.

    <p>
      Sites can be established and set-up with trapping commencing either in the
      morning or afternoon of the first day. If set up in the morning, traps
      must be checked in the afternoon or early evening.

</ul>
<p style="color: orange"><strong>Checking traps</strong></p>
<p style="color: orange">General</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure all surveyors avoid walking through the vegetation and soils plot
      to access the fauna plot during both the installation, and morning and
      afternoon trap checks. All foot traffic must go around the plot. This is
      important to maintain the integrity of the vegetation and soils plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All traps must be checked morning and afternoon during normal average
      weather conditions, and more often during hot or cold conditions. See
      Section 4.1.3.5 Ethical considerations .
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take care to assess the possible capture of a snake before picking up the
      funnel. If a venous snake is captured, use of a snake catching hook is
      recommended to carefully lift it from the funnel trap.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All traps must be accounted for at the end of each trap checking session.
      Surveyors must ensure that all traps are checked. Use of the app during
      all trap checking sessions will assist ensuring all traps are checked,
      with the surveyor alerted to any missed data entry and therefore possible
      missed traps.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Pitfalls and drift fences</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure the bottom of the pitfall is checked carefully, this includes
      turning over the soil and lifting any refuge material. Some reptiles,
      particularly legless lizards and blind snakes are exceptionally good at
      burying into the soil and hiding.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remove any invertebrates, including spiders, scorpions, ants and beetles
      that are often caught in pitfall traps (consider keeping for invertebrate
      samples).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Conduct any maintenance of the drift fence during each trap checking
      session, ensuring there are no gaps dug under, or branches laying across.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Funnels</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      After unzipping the funnel ensure the entrance material is lifted up to
      check for any small animals hiding, and the entire inside is searched
      carefully. Small reptiles, such as Morethia sp. lizards are easily missed.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Elliott’s and cages</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      When checking, both in the morning and afternoon, ensure the traps are
      well positioned out of direct sunlight. Re-position if necessary (and also
      re-position the flagging tape).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure traps remain in good working order throughout the survey.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure traps are checked in sequence, keep track of the Elliott number
      checked (as written on the trap). Using the app will assist ensuring all
      traps are checked.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Replenish bait once consumed. Note there is no need to replenish bait
      daily. The aim of the bait is to supply any captured animals with enough
      food to survive the night in the trap, not to act as a scent attractant.
    </p>

</ul>
<p style="color: orange"><strong>Ethical considerations</strong></p>
<p style="color: orange">Shelter and refuges</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Shelter, such as a handful of leaf litter and either a toilet roll or
      section of an egg carton, must be placed inside all pitfalls (refer to
      your animal ethics and scientific permit conditions as they may specify
      what must be used).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If cool overnight weather is expected, a small piece of insulation can be
      placed inside all pitfalls (refer to your animal ethics and scientific
      permit conditions as they may specify what can/must be used).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If frog captures are anticipated, or possible (i.e. rainfall expected in a
      dry arid environment), a wet sponge (~taking up no more than ¼ of the
      pitfall bottom to enable other animals to stay dry) should be placed
      inside all pitfalls and re-wet each afternoon.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All trap deaths must be documented. Ensure the trap type, date, time,
      species and any comments relevant to the cause are recorded. This
      information will be required for animal ethics and scientific permit
      report returns, as well as a specific reporting mechanisms required by the
      relevant jurisdiction. Assess the suitability of the carcass for whole
      specimen vouchering (see Section 6 Whole animal vouchering protocols ).

    <p>
      All conditions and guidelines of the animal ethics and scientific permit
      approval must be adhered to. The below guidelines are recommended if
      animal ethics conditions are not specific.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      During typical normal weather conditions for the location
      (&lt;34<sup>o</sup>C without significant rainfall), all traps must be
      checked and animals removed a minimum of twice per day, i.e. every 12 to
      14 hours, typically during the morning (within 2 hours of sunrise) and
      late afternoon.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On days of high temperatures (&gt;34<sup>o</sup>C):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Elliott’s and cages should be closed during the day (closed during the
          morning check and re-opened in the late afternoon), unless sufficient
          cover is provided to ensure traps are shaded all day and temperatures
          do not exceed 38<sup>o</sup>C
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          pitfalls can remain open during hot days &gt;34<sup>o</sup>C, but must
          also be checked in the middle of the day as well as the morning and
          afternoon checks (i.e., 6-7 am, 12-1 pm, 5-6 pm or similar depending
          on sunrise/set times)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          all traps must be checked and cleared (i.e., the last trap checked)
          within 3 hours of first light before temperatures have become warm to
          hot. Consequently, the field team should discuss such details the
          night before as departure times may need to be earlier than usual.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On days of extreme high temperatures (&gt;38<sup>o</sup>C):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Elliott and cage traps must be closed if the forecasted maximum
          temperature is expected to reach or exceed 38<sup>o</sup>C, i.e.,
          close during the morning check and re-opened late afternoon.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If high rainfall is expected (definition of high will depend on the local
      environment) trapping must cease and all traps closed (or removed) if high
      rainfall is expected and there is a risk that traps may not be checked at
      the scheduled time due to access restrictions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If low overnight minimum temperatures are expected, all pitfall, Elliott,
      cage and funnel traps must have insulation provided to aid animals
      maintaining body temperature. If trap deaths occur and thought
      attributable to low minimum temperatures, the surveyors must consider
      closing all traps until warmer temperatures are experienced.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the number of captures is high, and the time taken by the surveyors to
      check and clear traps is excessive and resulting in animals potentially
      being left in traps for longer than 12 hours, the surveyors must consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          closing some sites and recommencing later and staggering the number of
          sites concurrently surveyed
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          closing some traps, i.e. Elliott traps and focusing on pitfall and
          funnel traps – noting which traps were closed to ensure trap effort is
          accurately recorded, as a last resort
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          removing animals from the traps and releasing them immediately without
          full processing (i.e., recording where possible the species only, but
          no other measurements).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Ant attack</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If ants are present in high numbers (i.e., attacking the bait or captured
      animals) effort must be made to remove the threat and risk of attack.
      Firstly, the Elliott trap should be re-positioned to a better location;
      this may be several metres from the ideal trap line alignment (remember to
      re- flag the new location). Application of an insecticide, such as Baygon
      and Coopex, may be required. If ant attack or the risk of ant attack
      continues, consider closing the trap (ensuring the trap effort records are
      updated).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Additional permit requirements</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Some jurisdictions permit conditions require all fauna survey equipment
      that is used to capture animals to be clearly labelled. Check your permit
      conditions for any details that may be required, this may include your
      organisations name and contact phone number, and/or permit number.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Trapping conclusion and site pack-up</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All traps must be removed at the conclusion of the survey.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Permanent pitfalls may be left in situ following the conditions specified
      in the scientific permit and animal ethics approvals. All lids must be
      secure.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pitfall holes must be filled in as not cause a hazard for wildlife.</p>
  </li>
