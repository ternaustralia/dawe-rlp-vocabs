  Procedures to voucher animals are listed below. See Section 6.1.3 Additional
  guidelines below for important guidelines:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Re-check the whole animal vouchering decision tree to determine what
      animals will be vouchered ( see Figure). The decision tree should have
      already been consulted during the field trip planning and measuring
      marking modules.

    <p>
      Prepare the area where the processing will take place. It is recommended
      all processing (especially setting of reptiles) is conducted in a
      well-ventilated area, this may be best outside in the shade, utilizing a
      fold-up table. Arrange all necessary equipment, including dissecting tools
      (including sharp dissecting scissors, various tweezers), a cutting board,
      a small jar of water, voucher tags, gloves, needles of various sizes,
      syringes of various sizes, formalin, and the approved euthanizing drug.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Organize and allocate the voucher numbers to be used as determined by the
      voucher numbers allocated by the museum tags provided. Pre-fill any
      details from the capture’s datasheet (i.e., recorded in the field) onto
      the whole specimen voucher datasheet). There will be some doubling up of
      information, but this will aid rectifying any errors later. Ensure the
      specimen number, site location, capture number, capture date and species
      name are all completed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Prepare the voucher tags (see figure).</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Prepare the liver sample alcohol vials or Eppendorf tubes (if going into
      liquid nitrogen drum) (Figure).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Open the app, and select ‘Fauna module’, then ‘Add fauna voucher’. For
      ‘voucher type’, select ‘whole animal’.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Using the app, scan the QR on the capture bag (confirming the date, time,
      plot name, trap name, taxa and species, as entered using the Section :
      Identify, measure and release protocols at the point of capture, when
      ‘retain for vouchering’ was selected).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the morphometric details listed, as per the Section : Identify,
      measure and release protocols.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      euthanize the animal following protocols specific to your scientific
      permit and animal ethics approvals.
    </p>
    <p>See Additional guidelines for specific guidelines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Tie the voucher tag onto the specimen. See Additional guidelines for
      specific guidelines.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take a series of photographs, including the dorsal and ventral sides, a
      close of the head (front on, and side on), close-up of feet (especially
      rodents, dunnarts, geckos and frogs), any key distinguishing features
      (including reproductive markings and coloration, pores) and any unusual
      characteristics. Ideally have the animal laying on the scale card or along
      a ruler and ensure the museum voucher tag is visible in the photograph (or
      at least the first and last photograph of the series) for later cross-
      referencing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Collect a small piece of liver from the specimen. See Section: Removing
      liver samples below for instructions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Mammals: Place a small rolled up piece of paper towel in the mouth so that
      teeth can be inspected easily once preserved. Place small mammal into
      mammal formalin drum.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Reptiles: Proceed to the setting stage. See Section: Setting reptiles and
      frogs for preservation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Frogs: Proceed to the setting stage. See Section: Setting reptiles and
      frogs for preservation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Pack-up and clean all equipment. Ensure all equipment is safely stored,
      and drugs are secured.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="color: orange">Removing liver samples</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Using clean and very sharp scissors, make an incision into the area just
      below the animals sternum (just below the area where the upper rib cages
      connect), to just above the genital area (do not cut pouches and/or
      teats). The length of the incision is relative to the size of the animal.
      This is critical to allow penetration of the formalin for preserving the
      internal organs of the specimen once transferred to the formalin drum. If
      only a neat keyhole incision is made, the formalin solution cannot
      penetrate into the internal cavity of the specimen.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Locate the liver. The liver is usually easy to recognize, being a very
      rich red or maroon color. However, some geckos have pinkish color livers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Small mammals: Refer to Figure for approximate location of liver.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Microbats: as per small mammals. The liver can be difficult to locate
          on microbats. The liver is under the rib cage / sternum area. The
          tweezers will need to be entered at the top of the incision near the
          sternum and pushed gently on an angle under the rib cage. Making a
          diagonal incision to increase the size of the opening will make it
          easier to find and remove a liver sample.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Lizards: Refer to Figure for approximate location on a gecko, and
          Figure for a general reptile internal anatomy diagram.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Legless lizards: As per lizards.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Snakes: Refer to Figure for an illustration of the approximate liver
          location. The liver is linear in shape and is generally quite easy to
          locate.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Frogs: Refer to Figure for a general frog internal anatomy diagram.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once the liver is located, use scissors to cut out a small piece (about
      the size of pea).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use bunt tipped tweezers to lift out the liver sample. Do not use sharp
      tipped tweezers as they tend to pierce and cut the liver making it
      difficult to remove.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place the liver sample in the labelled alcohol vial or Eppendorf tube.
    </p>
  </li>

<p style="color: orange">Setting reptiles and frogs for preservation</p>
<p>
  The procedures used to set reptiles for preservation are listed below. See
  also Section: Additional guidelines.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Prepare the processing area, ensuring the working area is clear of
      un-necessary clutter, and all personnel in the vicinity are aware the
      processing is about to be conducted. Ensure no personnel eat, drink, or
      smoke in the area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Prepare the setting tray(s) (preferably a Tupperware container with lid),
      by placing one layer of paper towel in the base of the container. Thin
      cheap/generic brands of paper towel are recommended over thicker brands.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Prepare a batch of setting fluid using a large syringe (20:80 formalin to
      water). Connect a needle head to the syringe (the smaller the better).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Wet the paper towel with a small amount of water, just enough water so
      that the paper towel is moist (you do not want pools of water in the base
      of the container).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prepare each specimen for preservation by dry needling the carcass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Note it is best to prepare a batch of specimens at once, rather than
      one-by-one.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make a series of piercings into the ventral and dorsal side of the animal
      using a fine gauge needle head.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>The larger the reptile, the more piercings are required.</p></li>

  <li>
    <p>Inject the setting fluid into the carcass:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For small reptiles such as Lerista, Menetia, Lucasium, Ctenotus, etc.:
        </p>
        <p>
          inject a few drops of the setting fluid into the mouth and peritoneal
          cavity (where you removed the liver sample) of the specimen
        </p>
        <p>
          squirt a little of the setting fluid onto the paper towel where the
          specimen is to be placed - ensure sufficient space is allowed for
          additional specimens (it is important that you make the best use of
          room in the setting trays)
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              place the specimen into the setting tray, ventral side down (lying
              on their belly), into the specified position, i.e. tail curled
              into a ‘J’ position and toes and fingers spread apart (see
              Section: Additional guidelines: preservation for further
              information and a photograph)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              inject a generous squirt of the setting fluid over the upper side
              the specimen
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              squirt a generous amount of the setting fluid over the ventral
              side once the specimen is in the correct position
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For larger reptiles such as Nephrurus, Eremiascincus, Pogona, Egernia,
          Suta, Pseudonaja , etc.,
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              as with smaller reptiles inject a few drops of the setting fluid
              into the mouth and peritoneal cavity (where you removed the liver
              sample) of the specimen
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              in addition, inject a few drops of the setting fluid into the
              chest cavity, neck, limbs and tail
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              place the specimen into the setting tray, ventral side down (lying
              on their belly), into the specified position, i.e. tail curled
              into a ‘J’ position and toes and fingers spread apart (see Section
              : Additional guidelines: preservation for further information and
              a photograph)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              inject a generous squirt of the setting fluid over the upper side
              the specimen

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              squirt a generous amount of the setting fluid over the ventral
              side once the specimen is in the correct position
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For frogs:</p>
        <p>inject the setting fluid into chest cavity, neck, and limbs</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              squirt a little of the setting fluid onto the paper towel where

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              ensure sufficient space is allowed for additional specimens (it is
              important that you make the best use of room in the setting trays)
              place the specimen into the setting tray, ventral side down, into

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Gently place a single layer of paper towel over the specimens once
              they are set in the required positions (see: Additional
              guidelines: preservation for further information and a
              photograph).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Wet the paper towel (and specimens) with a final squirt of the
              setting fluid (Figure). The paper towel is required to be moist

              Place the lid on the setting tray. Take care not to be too rough
              with the setting tray as the specimens will easily move into
              different positions.

      On day 3 after setting, check the setting trays to ensure the specimens
      have been preserved sufficiently. There should be no signs of rotting, and
      paper towels should be damp not dry. Sometimes additional setting fluid
      may be required for limbs or tails that have not set properly or rotting
      chest cavities (indicated by softness and dark colouring). Leave any newly
      injected specimens in the setting tray for a further 1 to 2 days before
      transferring them into the large formalin drum. Do not open the setting
      tray over the 3 days to look or add other specimens as the formaldehyde
      gas escapes and the vouchers may not set properly.

<p style="color: orange">Euthanasia</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Required euthanasia methods will be governed by the applicable animal
      ethics committee and should also be discussed with the receiving museum.
      The method must meet the requirements of the Australian code for the care
      and use of animals for scientific purposes (NHMRC, 2013) for human
      killing, which states ‘The method and procedures used for killing an
      animal must be humane and:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          avoid pain or distress and produce rapid loss of consciousness until
          death occurs
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          be compatible with the purpose and aims of the project or activity
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          be appropriate to the species, age, developmental stage and health of
          the animal
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>require minimum restraint of the animal</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>be reliable, reproducible and irreversible</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          ensure that animals are killed in a quiet, clean environment away from
          other animals
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          ensure that death is established before disposal of the carcass’
          (NHMRC, 2013).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To meet animal ethics requirements, animals must be processed within 24
      hours of capture.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Euthanasia will typically occur via a lethal overdose of anaesthetic such
      as pento barbitone or another barbiturate. Surveyors must liaise with the
      receiving museum and relevant animal ethics committee to ensure guidelines
      and requirements are followed.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Personnel competencies</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Field surveyors taking whole animal specimens must have completed
      appropriate training. Training requirements and competencies must be
      discussed with the receiving museum as part of the field trip planning
      process. Competencies required are likely to be stated in the animal
      ethics documentation as well as scientific permit conditions. Required
      competencies will involve as a minimum:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          euthanasia methods (with training provided by a veterinarian or other
          equivalently trained professional)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          handling and transport of euthanasia drugs and preserving chemicals.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Equipment</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      You must have the suitable equipment to prepare, preserve and transport
      specimens. If you do not have all the appropriate equipment, you must not
      take specimens.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Attaching voucher tags to specimens</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The voucher tags are typically pre-made and supplied by the museum (e.g.
      the SA Museum supply voucher tags for specimens they will be receiving).
      Ensure that the voucher tags are used in numerical order.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Only use linen thread to tie the voucher tag to the specimen. Refer to
      Figure for a photograph of the preferred knot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The length of the linen thread (the gap between the specimen and the
      voucher tag) should be between 10 and 15 mm. The length of linen thread is
      important. If the tags are too long they end up becoming tangled together
      once the specimens are transferred to a large formalin drum.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Soak the linen thread in water so that it becomes more flexible. The
      thread is a lot easier to tie once wet.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Voucher tag placement</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Small mammal: tie the voucher tag to the hind leg (either hind leg is
      fine) behind the heel (tie the opposing knot at the opposite side to the
      tag). The knot needs to be reasonably tight so that the tag does not slip
      off.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Microbat: pierce a very small hole through the membrane below the point
      where the forearm and the ‘thumb’ meet. Tie the tag on the forearm side of
      the wing so that the wing can still be spread out.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Lizard: tie the voucher tag around the waist as per Figure (tie the
      opposing knot at the opposite side to the tag). Ensure the knot is not too
      tight that it cuts into the skin of the lizard.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Legless lizard: as per a standard lizard. Tie on the head side of the leg
      flaps (tie the opposing knot at the opposite side to the tag). Ensure the
      knot is not too tight that it cuts into the skin of the lizard.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Snake: tie the voucher tag on the neck. If the head length of the snake is
      &lt;30 mm then tie the tag approximately 60 mm from the snout of the
      snake. Ensure the knot is not too tight that it cuts into the skin of the
      snake.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Frog: tie the voucher tag around the waist of the frog (tie the opposing
      knot at the opposite side to the tag). Ensure the knot is not too tight
      that it cuts into the skin of the frog.
    </p>
  </li>

<p style="color: orange">Preservation</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once euthanased, animal specimens are required to be prepared for
      preservation. The receiving museum will provide instructions on how this
      can be achieved in the field, and any transfer requirements upon return.
      Specimens are typically stored in a formalin solution in the field and
      then transferred by the museum.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is easiest to set a batch of reptiles and frogs in one session. The
      number of individuals in a batch will generally be a determined by the
      number that can fit into a setting tray.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Tupperware branded airtight container are strongly recommended to be used
      as setting trays.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Setting is very time consuming and needs to be done correctly. It is
      beneficial to carry out the processing and setting with the assistance of
      a second person. One person can conduct the euthanasing, liver samples and
      placing of voucher tags whilst the second person concentrates solely on
      setting the reptiles.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Both reptiles and frogs need to be set shapes using a strong solution of
      formalin prior to being transferred into the large formalin drum. The
      animals are shaped specifically so that once set, the specimens can be
      inspected and key features can be easily accessed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Larger gauge heads will be required for large skinks with a tough
      exterior. Note the needles can be attached to a syringe for easier
      handling. Ensure that the needle head is replaced regularly to ensure
      sharp piercings are made. Take care not to be overly forceful when
      piercing the skin. Thicker skinned species such as Egernia, Moloch and
      larger elapids will require more force. The needle piercings allow the
      setting mixture (a mix of 20:80 formalin to water) to penetrate the scale
      and skin layer, enabling and essential for preservation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure the animals are set in the required position, ventral side down (on
      their belly):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Lizards: straight body with a curled tail (Figure 36). Also ensure
          that the arms and legs and toes and fingers are spread apart. This can
          be difficult when working with small skinks such as Lerista and
          Menetia . Small rocks or the plastic needle cover can be used to help
          hold the position of the tails.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Legless lizards: to be shaped in a loose paper clip shape (Figure 37)
          with the head of the lizard to outside of the coil.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Snakes: to be shaped in a loose coil with the head of the snake on the
          outside (Figure 38)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Frogs: straight body, with one straight leg, and one bent leg (i.e. in
          its natural bent up position). Ensure one leg is positioned straight,
          and one leg is positioned bent (i.e. in the animals natural bent
          position). Also ensure all fingers and toes are spread apart.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be sure not to inject too much fluid so that the body parts become bloated
      and look disfigured. A lack of fluid will cause the internals of the
      specimen to deteriorate and rot
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Data completion</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure all data is completed in the App module and specimen voucher
      numbers updated on the captures datasheet. This makes things easier when
      returning from large surveys with multiple voucher specimens and entering
      data.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the animal has died as a result of the survey (i.e. trap death, or
