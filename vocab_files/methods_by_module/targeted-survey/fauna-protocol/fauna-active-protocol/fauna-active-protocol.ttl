    ns1:instructions """<p>Active survey</p>
<ol start="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      To commence an active survey, select Start Survey to record the starting
      position for the survey (coordinates automatically recorded, ensure R1 has
      high accuracy) and the start time for active searches.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once the survey has started, the app will record a track log. Tracks will
      be visible in the built in map screen and can be used to assist with
      systematic navigation across the survey area and to ensure good coverage
      of suitable habitats.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If any of the target species or signs of the target species are observed
      during the survey, select the Add Observation button. Use the Add habitat
      button, if areas of potential suitable habitat are located. See Appendix 6
      for details about recording habitat boundaries. Any observations recorded
      during the survey will be displayed on the mapping interface screen.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Complete all required fields on the Observation or Habitat screens (see
      Figure 4 or Figure 5 respectively). Only the species identified as target
      species at the beginning of the survey can be selected from the species
      drop-down list. If an observation about another species needs to be
      recorded, use the Opportune module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Photos can be taken of any observations, signs or suitable habitat
      (optional). Photos should be labelled with a short description.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If possible and required, collect a voucher specimen (includes full
      specimens, scats, remains, feathers etc). Only applicable if Add
      Observation is selected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Multiple observations or multiple areas of potential habitat can be
      recorded during a single survey, by selecting either the Add Observation
      or Add Habitat buttons on the main screen (the app will automatically
      return to this screen).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once the entire survey area has been searched, ensure that any additional
      information about the survey or observations has been recorded in the
      Comments field (free text, optional), then select End Survey to record the
      survey end time and location and to complete the track log.
