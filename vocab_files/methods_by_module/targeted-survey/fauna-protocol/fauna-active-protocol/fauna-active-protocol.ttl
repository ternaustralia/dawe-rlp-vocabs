    <h3 id="additional-guidelines">Additional guidelines</h3>
<h4 id="preparation">A. Preparation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure the necessary permits and approvals have been obtained before
      scheduling any surveys.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consult with the relevant museum before any voucher collection: for
      guidance on how many specimens should be collected from a particular site
      over a particular time period; to ensure the use of proper preservation
      and holding techniques; to determine the availability of necessary
      equipment; for guidance on the collection of essential data. Consultation
      with the museum may also be a requirement of animal ethics committee
      approval.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Other institutions/experts may also be consulted, where appropriate, as
      there might be specific project or vouchering requirements additional to
      those of the museum.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Review recommended survey methods and survey equipment for each target
      species.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The survey methods in each EPBC Act threatened species profile should be
      regarded as a minimum and should be included in the general survey program
      where relevant (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚ Water‚
      Population and Communities 2011a).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure that all field staff are component with the techniques and
      equipment that will be used.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The <em>Vertebrate Fauna</em> module should be reviewed before undertaking
      any targeted vertebrate fauna surveys.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The <em><a
          href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/0ad98270-707f-4a78-acd1-666faa2c124e"
          >Invertebrate fauna</a
        ></em> module should be reviewed before
      undertaking any targeted invertebrate fauna surveys.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If invertebrate specimens are to be collected, ensure that sampling
      containers (are prepared in advance.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-survey">B. Field survey</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      During active methods, data can only be collected against species
      identified as target species at the start of the survey. The drop-down
      list will only contain the species selected. To record information about
      observations of other species, use the <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/6fd39a33-9c4f-469e-80a5-e76b5d5f04a6">Opportunistic observation</a></em> module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Measurements can be recorded during active searches, if the individual can
      be hand-captured. This is optional and should only be undertaken if it can
      be done so without causing any harm.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To record the extent of suitable habitat during an active survey, traverse
      the boundary of the suitable habitat and use the app to record the area.
      The area will need to be recorded in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise
      direction. Care needs to be taken to ensure that all points are collected
      sequentially (see the supporting information for more details).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Finish drawing the habitat area at least 5-10 m away from the start point
      to avoid any errors associated with overlapping polygons occurring.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Photos should be in focus and include something for scale (scale card, pen
      etc). Multiple photos can be taken of the same individual to document
      different features. All photos should be labelled with a description of
      what has been captured in the photo.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The mapping interface can be used to navigate around the project area. As
      observations or equipment are added, they will automatically be added to
      the interface.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Tracks will be recorded throughout the survey, but are particularly
      important for active surveys.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where signs are detected, but are not sufficient to distinguish between
      species, then direct survey methods targeting the locations where signs of
      fauna activity were detected are required to provide a definite species
      identification (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚ Water‚
      Population and Communities 2011a).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For example, the location where scats are detected can be targeted to
      increase the chance of making a direct observation for a target fauna
      species (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚ Water‚ Population and
      Communities 2011a).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Temporal replication may be necessary to detect populations that fluctuate
      in abundance, occurrence or detectability with time, especially when these
      fluctuations are unpredictable (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚
      Water‚ Population and Communities 2011b).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If targeting a migratory species, field survey times should be tailored to
      migration times. A number of surveys may be required over this time to
      detect species.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Different species have different seasonal and daily peaks of activity
      based on their biology and the weather. Conduct surveys at the time of
      year and day when those species are most likely to be active and during
      weather conditions favouring activity (Department of Environment and
      Climate Change 2009).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As fauna survey results are weather dependent, several potential survey
      dates should be set aside (Department of Environment and Climate Change
      2009).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All persons conducting field surveys should be experienced and competent
      in surveying and be familiar with the target species (Department of
      Environment and Climate Change 2009).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If trapping and handling is required, all persons should be experienced
      with trapping and handling techniques.

    >
    for steps 1 to 5.
  </p>
  <li>
    <p>
      To commence an active survey, select <em>Start Survey</em> to record the
      starting position for the survey (coordinates automatically recorded,
      ensure R1 has high accuracy) and the start time for active searches.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once the survey has started, the app will record a track log. Tracks will
      be visible in the built in map screen and can be used to assist with
      systematic navigation across the survey area and to ensure good coverage
      of suitable habitats.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If any of the target species or signs of the target species are observed
      during the survey, select the <em>Add Observation</em> button. Use the
      <em>Add habitat</em> button, if areas of potential suitable habitat are
      located. See <a href='#appendix-6'>Appendix 6</a> for details about recording habitat boundaries.
      Any observations recorded during the survey will be displayed on the
      mapping interface screen.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Complete all required fields on the <em>Observation</em> or
      <em>Habitat</em> screens (see <a href='#figure-4'>Figure 4</a> or <a href='#figure-5'>Figure 5</a> respectively). Only the
      species identified as target species at the beginning of the survey can be
      selected from the species drop-down list. If an observation about another
      species needs to be recorded, use the <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/6fd39a33-9c4f-469e-80a5-e76b5d5f04a6">Opportunistic observation</a></em> module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Photos can be taken of any observations, signs or suitable habitat
      (optional). Photos should be labelled with a short description.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If possible and required, collect a voucher specimen (includes full
      specimens, scats, remains, feathers etc). Only applicable if
      <em>Add Observation</em> is selected.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Multiple observations or multiple areas of potential habitat can be
      recorded during a single survey, by selecting either the
      <em>Add Observation</em> or <em>Add Habitat</em> buttons on the main
      screen (the app will automatically return to this screen).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once the entire survey area has been searched, ensure that any additional
      information about the survey or observations has been recorded in the
      <em>Comments</em> field (free text, optional), then select
      <em>End Survey</em> to record the survey end time and location and to
      complete the track log.
