    <p>
      To undertake a passive survey that involves the placement of traps or
      other equipment in the field, select Start Survey. This will bring up the
      mapping interface and display the project area. Select Set-up if a new
      survey is being undertaken or Check/Collect if equipment has already been
      placed in the landscape (proceed to step 21 for checking and collecting
      equipment).

      To set up a new survey, navigate around the project area and determine the
      suitable placement of equipment (traps, sand plots, acoustic recorders
      etc).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the Add Equipment button to record the location of every piece of
      survey equipment placed in the field.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Fill in the required fields on the trapping/equipment screen, including
      trap or equipment type, name (unique trap ID), dimensions, orientation,
      and if bait has been used.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Record micro-habitat information for each location.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take a photo of the trap or equipment set up (optional, but recommended).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select Save to return to the previous screen or Cancel to discard the
      record.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record any other traps or equipment set up in the project area by
      repeating steps 15-20.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once all traps or equipment have been set up, click Complete Set-up. This
      will complete the first stage of the survey, but will leave the survey
      active, so details about any captures or collection of recordings can be
      entered.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If more equipment needs to be added, on the main screen of the Targeted
      Surveys app, select the Return to Survey option and select the appropriate
      survey from the list available. This will bring up the survey page. Select
      Set up to continue adding equipment.
