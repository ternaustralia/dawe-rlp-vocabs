    Record survey effort and any observations of target ecological communities within the project area.
    This module serves as a sub-protocol of the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/420ce0a7-9364-4bf4-861c-ef5f710e31b9">Targeted survey</a> module. 
    Prior to implementing this protocol, it is essential to thoroughly review the Introduction, Key Definitions and Terminology,
    Rationale, and Module Overview provided in the "<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/420ce0a7-9364-4bf4-861c-ef5f710e31b9">Targeted survey</a>" module.
    These sections will provide you with important contextual information and a comprehensive understanding of the protocol.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Obtain a list of TECs that may be present within the project area. Ensure
      that all surveyors are familiar with the communities and listings.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Refer to the SPRAT website for more information about the EPBC listed
      communities:

        ></a
      >
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Review any documents about each of the target communities, including
      survey recommendations and condition thresholds.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Factors that can influence search timing include light, bad weather, wet
      grass, steep slopes and time of the day. Consider these factors during
      field planning and when scheduling surveys.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Very dense vegetation can significantly increase the time required for
      traverses or meander-based searches. Ensure that enough time has been
      allocated based on the conditions expected within the project area.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="field-survey-2">B. Field survey</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be as accurate as possible with recording the location of the record.
      Ensure that the R1 is turned on with high accuracy.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter all required fields in the App (a warning message will appear when
      attempting to save the record if required fields are not entered). Refer
      to the information buttons in the App for clarification regarding the data
      collection and entry requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Disturbance impacts should be minimised. Avoid trampling on native
      vegetation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Walk along the field traverse making a visual sweep either side and along
      the traverse. If a target community is detected along a traverse, record
      the GPS coordinates and record the community boundary.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A GPS track log will be recorded to show the location and extent of field
      traverses. This will demonstrate that the survey has been systematic and
      comprehensive.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      For safety reasons, systematic searching of rocky outcrops and crevices is
      not recommended. Inaccessible areas can be searched with binoculars for a
      safe vantage point. If safe to do so, meander surveys may be more
      appropriate for these areas. GPS track logs will still be recorded, but
      not required to occur in parallel manner.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In areas of preferred habitat for ecological communities, an area can be
      searched using the meander technique. This allows for greater coverage of
      areas than plot-based surveys and is less time consuming. It involves
      traversing areas of suitable habitat in no set pattern, but roughly back
      and forth, whilst searching for a particular, or several, threatened plant
      species (Department of Environment and Conservation 2004).
