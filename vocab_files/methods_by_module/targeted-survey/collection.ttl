  This module provides guidelines for undertaking a desktop study and then
  covers the procedures and guidelines for recording the survey methods, effort
  and outcomes of targeted surveys and monitoring for species or ecological
  communities. Targeted surveys do not need to occur at a plot, and where the
  project or research goals of individual projects dictate variation in survey
  or trap design, or use of methods not applied during plot-based surveys, the
  Targeted surveys module should be used. Targeted surveys should not be viewed
  as an alternative to standardised plot-based surveys and should generally be
  used in addition to plot-based surveys, to obtain further information about
  species or ecological communities.
</p>
<p>The module contains three protocols:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Fauna protocol</strong> – to record survey type, survey effort and
      any observations of target fauna species or suitable habitat within the
      project area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Flora protocol</strong> – to record survey effort and any
      observations of target flora species, populations or suitable habitat
      within the project area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Ecological community protocol</strong> – to record survey effort
      and any observations of target ecological communities within the project
      area.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>This module has links to the following modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Vertebrate fauna – provides further details on vertebrate fauna survey,
      collection and vouchering methods. Fauna surveys can trigger the need for
      targeted surveys if a threatened species is identified at a plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Invertebrate fauna – provides further details on invertebrate fauna
      survey, collection and vouchering methods. Invertebrate fauna surveys can
      trigger the need for targeted surveys if a threatened or invasive species
      is identified at a plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Opportunistic observations – opportunistic observations of species of
      interest (e.g. threatened or invasive) may trigger the need for targeted
      surveys.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Floristics – provides further details on vascular plant collection and
      vouchering methods. Floristics surveys can trigger the need for targeted
      surveys if a threatened species is identified at a plot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Plant vouchering – provides further details on vascular plant collection
      and vouchering methods.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Camera traps – provides further details on camera trap methods and set up.
      The point protocol in the Camera traps module can be used for targeted
      surveys.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Vegetation mapping - the results from the vegetation mapping module can be
      used to indicate potential habitat areas that may require a targeted
      survey and the presence of any TECs. If a threatened or invasive species
      is detected at a vegetation mapping point, this may trigger the need for a
      targeted survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Recruitment – the survivorship protocol in the Recruitment module can be
      used to track survival, growth and life-stages of individual plants
      overtime, and can be used to monitor target flora species.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Desktop study</strong></p>
<p>
  One of the first steps when undertaking a targeted survey should always be to
  complete a desktop study or review, to gather contextual information on the
  area and species/community to be surveyed from existing surveys or reports,
  scientific literature, database searches and spatial information (see
  Appendices 1 and 2 for resources to assist with desktop studies). Desktop
  studies can help to plan and undertake field surveys (Environment Protection
  Authority 2020), and the information collated can be used to make informed
  decisions on the appropriate level of survey effort, key survey methods and
  techniques, stratification of the project area and can feed into background
  information for reporting. Desktop studies should involve a search for all
  relevant sources of literature, data and map-based information (Freeman et al.
  2015, Environment Protection Authority 2020), and requires a thorough
  examination of the literature to identify the best times, locations and
  techniques for the survey (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚ Water‚
  Population and Communities 2011a).
</p>
<p>There are a range of sources that can be reviewed, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Databases maintained by the Australian Government, including the Species
      Profile and Threats (SPRAT) database and the Protected Matters Search Tool
      (see
      <u>http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/sprat.pl</u> and
      <u>https://www.awe.gov.au/environment/epbc/protected-matters-search-tool</u>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      State and Territory conservation agencies and local government databases
      and predictive models
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      National and State/Territory threatened species recovery plans and teams
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference books, including field identification guides</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Aerial photographs and satellite imagery, topographic maps, vegetation
      maps, geological maps and soils maps
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Historic records and flora, fauna and vegetation communities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Lists of threatened species, populations or ecological communities in the
      area
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Literature about the ecology of the species, communities and habitats
      found or likely to be found in the area
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consultation with local groups, researchers and experts (Department of the
      Environment 2013b).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All information used in a desktop study requires an evaluation of its
  reliability and suitability for the current project, including the source and
  age of the information, suitability of techniques used, skills and experience
  of observer/researcher, data analysis and survey timing (DEC 2004, Environment
  Protection Authority 2020).
</p>
<p>
  When undertaking a desktop assessment, the following can be points can be used
  as a guide when planning, designing and undertaking surveys:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The number and location of species records, and dates of those records
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distribution of species, population and ecological communities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The location and extent of suitable habitats within the project area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Current threats to the species or ecological communities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommended time(s) of year to survey</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommended time(s) of day to survey</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optimal survey conditions (rainfall, wind, temperature etc)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Length of survey (i.e., number of trap nights) and survey effort (number
      of traps, search area)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Best practice survey methods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommended equipment and use</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Site access and logistics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Necessary skills and experience</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habitat requirements and phenology (flora species).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  A key process to undertake when planning a field survey is stratification of
  the project area. Stratification involves breaking the project area into
  assessment units that are relatively homogeneous, and these units are then
  used to determine the location and number of sites that are needed to
  adequately survey the habitat types present across the project area (Eyre et
  al. 2018). Vegetation maps, aerial photographs, topographic maps, occurrence
  records and satellite imagery can be useful for stratification and determining
  locations for targeted searches (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚
  Water‚ Population and Communities 2011a).
</p>
<p>
  Habitat preferences of the target species or community should be considered
  during the site selection process, and it is common for survey effort to be
  higher in areas of suitable habitat (Environmental Protection Authority
  2016a). However, targeting survey effort to strata with high probability of
  occupancy risks misinterpreting true patterns of occurrence, as survey designs
  that rely heavily on previous knowledge have the risk of becoming
  self-fulfilling prophecies, as they uncritically reinforce underlying
  assumptions (Cristescu et al. 2019). In addition, the habitat needs and
  behaviour of many threatened species are often poorly understood (Department
  of Environment and Conservation NSW 2004). Consequently, all potentially
  suitable habitats should be systematically searched for targeted species or
  ecological communities (Environmental Protection Authority 2016a), and
  exclusion of habitat should only be to areas where a species or community
  cannot exist (Cristescu et al. 2019).
</p>
<p>
  Timing of surveys is also an important consideration when planning surveys.
  Careful consideration of the necessary lead time is required, as it may be
  necessary to survey at specific times of the year, depending on the ecology of
  the species in the subject area, or to undertake multiple surveys across the
  year or across years (Department of the Environment‚ Water‚ Heritage and the
  Arts 2010b). Many species will vary in detectability between seasons because
  of behavioural differences or variation in habitat conditions (Department of
  the Environment‚ Water‚ Heritage and the Arts 2010b).
</p>
<p>
  Surveys should be undertaken when the target species and/or communities are
  most detectable and identifiable in the field, (i.e. for flora, during the
  relevant flowering/fruiting time for each species) (Environmental Protection
  Authority 2016a). For areas with multiple significant species, there may not
  be a single time of the year suitable to detect all species, and in these
  cases, multiple visits, each targeting different species or groups should be
  considered (Environment Protection Authority 2020). For example, many cryptic
  and rare plants are more detectable during flowering or seed set, and the
  timing of these can vary across the year (NSW National Parks and Wildlife
  Service and SMEC Australia 2001), while peak invertebrate activity often
  coincides with rainfall events, which are difficult to predict (EPA 2016b).
