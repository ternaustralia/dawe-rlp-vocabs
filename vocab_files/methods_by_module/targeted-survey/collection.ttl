    <h3 id="module-overview">Module overview</h3>
<p>
  This module provides guidelines for undertaking a desktop study and then
  covers the procedures and guidelines for recording the survey methods, effort
  and outcomes of targeted surveys and monitoring for species or ecological
  communities. Targeted surveys do not need to occur at a plot, and where the
  project or research goals of individual projects dictate variation in survey
  or trap design, or use of methods not applied during plot-based surveys, the
  <em>Targeted surveys</em> module should be used. Targeted surveys should not
  be viewed as an alternative to standardised plot-based surveys, and should
  generally be used in addition to plot-based surveys, to obtain further
  information about particular species or ecological communities.
</p>
<p>The module contains three protocols:</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Fauna protocol</strong> – to record survey type, survey effort and
      any observations of target fauna species or suitable habitat within the
      project area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Flora protocol</strong> – to record survey effort and any
      observations of target flora species, populations or suitable habitat
      within the project area.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Ecological community protocol</strong> – to record survey effort
      and any observations of target ecological communities within the project
      area.
    </p>

<h3 id="desktop-study">Desktop study</h3>
<p>
  One of the first steps when undertaking a targeted survey should always be to
  complete a desktop study or review, to gather contextual information on the
  area and species/community to be surveyed from existing surveys or reports,
  scientific literature, database searches and spatial information (see
  <a href='#appendix-1'>Appendix 1</a> and <a href='#appendix-2'>Appendix 2</a> for resources to assist with desktop studies). Desktop
  studies can help to plan and undertake field surveys (Environment Protection
  Authority 2020), and the information collated can be used to make informed
  decisions on the appropriate level of survey effort, key survey methods and
  techniques, stratification of the project area and can feed into background
  information for reporting. Desktop studies should involve a search for all
  relevant sources of literature, data and map-based information (Freeman et al.
  2015, Environment Protection Authority 2020), and requires a thorough
  examination of the literature to identify the best times, locations and
  techniques for the survey (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚ Water‚
  Population and Communities 2011a).
</p>

<p>There are a range of sources that can be reviewed, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Databases maintained by the Australian Government, including the Species
      Profile and Threats (SPRAT) database and the Protected Matters Search Tool
      (see
      <a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/sprat.pl"
        ><u>http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/sprat.pl</u></a
      >
      and

          >https://www.awe.gov.au/environment/epbc/protected-matters-search-tool</u
        ></a
      >).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      State and Territory conservation agencies and local government databases
      and predictive models
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      National and State/Territory threatened species recovery plans and teams
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference books, including field identification guides</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Aerial photographs and satellite imagery, topographic maps, vegetation
      maps, geological maps and soils maps
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Historic records and flora, fauna and vegetation communities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Lists of threatened species, populations or ecological communities in the
      area
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Literature about the ecology of the species, communities and habitats
      found or likely to be found in the area
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consultation with local groups, researchers and experts (Department of the
      Environment 2013b).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All information used in a desktop study requires an evaluation of its
  reliability and suitability for the current project, including the source and
  age of the information, suitability of techniques used, skills and experience
  of the observer/researcher, data analysis and survey timing (DEC 2004,
  Environment Protection Authority 2020).
</p>
<p>
  When undertaking a desktop assessment, the following can be points can be used
  as a guide when planning, designing and undertaking surveys:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The number and location of species records, and dates of those records
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distribution of species, population and ecological communities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The location and extent of suitable habitats within the project area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Current threats to the species or ecological communities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommended time(s) of year to survey</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommended time(s) of day to survey</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optimal survey conditions (rainfall, wind, temperature etc)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Length of survey (i.e. number of trap nights) and survey effort (number of
      traps, search area)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Best practice survey methods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommended equipment and use</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Site access and logistics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Necessary skills and experience</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habitat and behaviour (fauna species)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Habitat requirements and phenology (flora species).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  A key process to undertake when planning a field survey is stratification of
  the project area. Stratification involves breaking the project area into
  assessment units that are relatively homogeneous, and these units are then
  used to determine the location and number of sites that are needed to
  adequately survey the habitat types present across the project area (Eyre et
  al. 2018). Vegetation maps, aerial photographs, topographic maps, occurrence
  records and satellite imagery can be useful for stratification and determining
  locations for targeted searches (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚
  Water‚ Population and Communities 2011a).
</p>
<p>
  Habitat preferences of the target species or community should be considered
  during the site selection process, and it is common for survey efforts to be
  higher in areas of suitable habitat (Environmental Protection Authority
  2016a). However, targeting survey effort to strata with high probability of
  occupancy risks misinterpreting true patterns of occurrence, as survey designs
  that rely heavily on previous knowledge have the risk of becoming
  self-fulfilling prophecies, as they uncritically reinforce underlying
  assumptions (Cristescu et al. 2019). In addition, the habitat needs and
  behaviour of many threatened species are often poorly understood (Department
  of Environment and Conservation NSW 2004). Consequently, all potentially
  suitable habitats should be systematically searched for targeted species or
  ecological communities (Environmental Protection Authority 2016a), and
  exclusion of habitat should only be to areas where a species or community
  cannot exist (Cristescu et al. 2019).
</p>
<p>
  Timing of surveys is also an important consideration when planning surveys.
  Careful consideration of the necessary lead time is required, as it may be
  necessary to survey at specific times of the year, depending on the ecology of
  the species in the subject area, or to undertake multiple surveys across the
  year or across years (Department of the Environment‚ Water‚ Heritage and the
  Arts 2010b). Many species will vary in detectability between seasons because
  of behavioural differences or variation in habitat conditions (Department of
  the Environment‚ Water‚ Heritage and the Arts 2010b).
</p>
<p>
  Surveys should be undertaken when the target species and/or communities are
  most detectable and identifiable in the field, (i.e. for flora, during the
  relevant flowering/fruiting time for each species) (Environmental Protection
  Authority 2016a). For areas with multiple significant species, there may not
  be a single time of the year suitable to detect all species, and in these
  cases, multiple visits, each targeting different species or groups should be
  considered (Environment Protection Authority 2020). For example, many cryptic
  and rare plants are more detectable during flowering or seed set, and the
  timing of these can vary across the year (NSW National Parks and Wildlife
  Service and SMEC Australia 2001), while peak invertebrate activity often
  coincides with rainfall events, which are difficult to predict (EPA 2016b).

          Threatened species are those plant and animal species considered to be
          at risk of extinction in the wild. There are different scales for how
          a species may be considered threatened. Under the EPBC Act, listed
          threatened species are categorised as follows, based on International
          Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria:
        </p>
        <p>
          Critically endangered - extremely high risk of extinction in the wild
          in the immediate future;
        </p>
        <p>
          Endangered - very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near
          future;
        </p>
        <p>
          Vulnerable - high risk of extinction in the wild in medium-term
          future; and
        </p>
        <p>
          Conservation dependent - focus of a specific conservation program
          without which the species would enter one of the above categories.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the requirements under the EPBC Act, individual states
          and territories may also have their own threatened species listings.

  Appendix 2. Protected matters search tool (PMST) and Species profile and

</h4>
<p>
  Key resources for planning and undertaking targeted surveys for threatened
  species or ecological communities are the Australian Government Department of
  Agriculture, Water and the Environment, protected matters search tool (PMST)
  and species profile and threats database (SPRAT).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>PMST</strong> –
      <a
        href="https://www.awe.gov.au/environment/epbc/protected-matters-search-tool"

          >https://www.awe.gov.au/environment/epbc/protected-matters-search-tool</u
        ></a
      >
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The PMST generates a report that help to determine whether MNES of
          other matters protected by the EPBC Act are likely to occur in the
          project area.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          THE PMST allows users to draw a feature around an area of interest,
          explore what’s in the area and generate a report.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Three terms are used to indicate the likelihood of occurrence of a
          threatened species, species habitat ecological community or within the
          project area:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Known to occur</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Likely to occur</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>May occur</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

<p>
  This module provides the opportunity to record survey data that does not fit
  the standard requirements of the other modules. The
  <em>Targeted surveys</em> module has been designed primarily for targeting
  threatened or migratory species or TECs listed under the EPBC Act, but can
  also be used for research projects focussed on specific species or ecological
  communities, for state or territory listed species or communities, or for
  surveys of invasive species. The <em>Targeted surveys</em> module allows for
  greater flexibility in survey design compared to the plot-based modules, and
  can be undertaken in addition to plot-based surveys (recommended) or in
  situations where plot-based surveys are not suitable.
</p>
<p>
  The methods used for targeted surveys should be used consistently and be
  recorded and mapped in sufficient detail to allow replication (Department of
  Environment and Conservation 2004). However, this does not always occur and
  can limit the ability to repeat surveys and collate and analyse data to allow
  comparisons across projects or overtime. Consequently, setting minimum data
  standards will help ensure that field surveys are undertaken in a transparent
  manner and that survey design and effort can be verified, along with any
  observation data (Dyer and Simmonds 2021). The targeted module is focused on
  recording what was done, how it was done and what was observed in a
  standardized manner, while allowing flexibility in terms of the actual field
  survey methods undertaken. A GPS track log of the location of the survey is
  the most effective way of demonstrating that the survey has been systematic
  and comprehensive (Department of Planning 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Threatened species may not be detected during plot-based surveys, due to
  patchy distributions, cryptic behaviour or habits, low population sizes or
  localised habitat requirements (Eyre et al. 2018, Department of Planning
  2020). In addition, it is generally not adequate to report the presence and
  distribution of listed species or ecological communities on the basis of their
  occurrence within plots alone (Environmental Protection Authority 2016a). If
  they are detected during more general surveys, follow up surveys are required
  to determine their distribution, extent and population trends (Department of
  Biodiversity‚ Conservation and Attractions 2017, Eyre et al. 2018, Department
  of Planning 2020). Targeted surveys are also useful for habitats that are
  restricted in the landscape, so may not be part of plot-based surveys, but may
  still be important for biodiversity (Eyre et al. 2018).
</p>
<p>
  To survey and monitor threatened or migratory species and ecological
  communities, there is a need for many projects to adopt specific,
  individualised monitoring methods to address localised or target-specific
  questions (Capon et al. 2020), in addition to baseline survey methods.
  Threatened species and TECs are two of the key areas of Commonwealth
  environmental responsibility targeted by the Regional Lands Partnership (RLP)
  program. The majority of projects funded under the RLP program are primarily
  focussed on outcomes associated with threatened species, followed by TECs
  (Capon et al. 2020). The long term aims are to determine if the trajectories
  of targeted or threatened species has improved and if the condition of EPBC
  Act TECs has been enhanced, based on extent, distribution, population size,
  reproduction, habitat availability, composition, structure, function and
  connectivity (Capon et al. 2020).
</p>
<p>
  Targeted surveys for nationally threatened or migratory species and TECs,
  recognised as Matters of National Environmental Significance (MNES) under the
  EPBC Act, are central to environmental impact assessments (EIAs) (DEC 2004,
  Department of Planning 2020, Dyer and Simmonds 2021). Any action that is
  likely to have a significant impact on MNES must be referred to the Minister
  and undergo an EIA and approvals process (Department of the Environment 2013a,
  Ward et al. 2019, DAWE 2021c), and this process will be a common trigger for
  undertaking this module.
</p>
<p>
  It is important that informed decisions are made regarding the impact of
  development proposals on threatened species and TECs (Department of
  Environment and Conservation 2004, Reside et al. 2019, Ward et al. 2019,
  Simmonds et al. 2020). For EIAs, field surveys should be designed to assess
  any threatened biodiversity which may occur in the project area, to determine
  the likelihood and extent of occurrence, and how the proposal will impact upon
  them or their suitable habitat (DEC 2004, Department of Sustainability‚
  Environment‚ Water‚ Population and Communities 2011a). Measures such as
  population size and trends, and the area and quality of habitat available
  across the landscape are also important variables that need to be thoroughly
  assessed and well documented (Samuel 2020).

<p>
  The <em>Targeted surveys</em> module covers the procedures and guidelines for
  recording the field survey information of targeted surveys for flora (vascular
  and non-vascular), fauna (vertebrate and invertebrate) and ecological
  communities. Targeted surveys can be used for baseline surveys and ongoing
  monitoring. The <em>Targeted surveys</em> module has been developed primarily
  for threatened species and ecological communities, but can also be used for
  invasive plants, or any other taxa of interest, including migratory species.
  Protocols for targeted vertebrate fauna pest surveys are being developed
  concurrently.
</p>
<p>
  Targeted surveys may take many forms and can be utilised outside of plots, so
  this module provides the opportunity to undertake surveys that do not align
  with the standard requirements of the other plot-based modules. In most
  instances, targeted surveys should be undertaken in addition to plot-based
  surveys and should not be viewed as an alternative to carrying out the
  standardised plot-based methods. The module is flexible and focussed on
  standardising how information about targeted surveys are collected, including
  survey area, type, design and effort, rather than providing prescriptive
  guidelines for how each survey needs to be completed. Any observations of
  target species or potential suitable habitat, and ecological communities
  recorded during a targeted survey is also standardised, making the process of
  undertaking a targeted survey more transparent, ensuring that minimum data
  standards are met and facilitating data re-use between projects. The module is
  focussed on consistent collection of minimum metadata requirements, but in
  some instances individual projects may have additional data requirements.
</p>
<p>
  Survey methods and the time and extent of search effort vary widely between
  studies and the species or community targeted, and for this reason, it is
  essential that detailed information on the methods used and search effort is
  collected. Key details include who was involved, what work was carried out and
  where, when and how the survey was conducted, time spent searching, and a GPS
  log of the search area, as well as the climatic conditions at the time of the
  survey (Department of Sustainability‚ Environment‚ Water‚ Population and
  Communities 2011a, Department of Planning 2020). Targeted flora and ecological
  community surveys generally consist of active searching, while fauna surveys
  can involve a combination of active searching and passive survey techniques,
  such as trapping, acoustic recorders and remote cameras (Department of the
  Environment‚ Water‚ Heritage and the Arts 2010b, Department of Sustainability‚
  Environment‚ Water‚ Population and Communities 2011a, Department of
  Environment and Science 2020, Tolsma and Molloy 2020).
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Targeted surveys</em> module should be used in combination with any
  national or state guidelines detailing field survey techniques for the target
  species or community under study, along with any other available information
  (e.g. recovery plans, scientific studies). Targeted surveys for specific
  species should consider the ecology, habitat requirements and behaviour of the
  species (Eyre et al. 2018). They may follow established survey protocols (e.g.
  EPBC Act threatened species survey guidelines), or be developed based on up to
  date scientific knowledge and expert recommendations, but justification needs
  to be provided for the survey method adopted (Department of Sustainability‚
  Environment‚ Water‚ Population and Communities 2011a, b).
</p>
<h3 id="fauna">Fauna</h3>
<p>
  Targeted fauna surveys are generally used to gather information on significant
  fauna species and/or habitats or collect data where a desktop study or field
  survey has identified knowledge gaps (Environment Protection Authority 2020).
  Examples of where targeted fauna surveys are appropriate include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Confirming the presence of a threatened species or migratory species, or
      other species of interest within a project area
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Determining the distribution, abundance and/or health of a target species

</ul>
<h3 id="flora">Flora</h3>
<p>
  Targeted flora surveys are generally used to document the presence of
  threatened plant species (or other species of interest), and when observed,
  determine the size and extent of populations in the project area
  (Environmental Protection Authority 2016a). Additional information such as
  growth and life-stages and plant health are also key measures that should be
  documented during targeted surveys.
</p>
<p>
  Within the project area, the focus areas for survey are selected based on a
  desktop assessment (see Section 3), the range of habitats present and the
  observed suitability of habitat. Three commonly used methods for targeted
  flora surveys are random meanders, parallel traverses (or transects) and
  quadrats. There can be a number of variations to each of these approaches,
  often tailored to the target species or habitat (Department of Planning 2020),
  but all approaches involve actively searching.
</p>
<p>
  Parallel field traverses are the recommended approach for targeted surveys as
  they allow survey areas to be searched systematically, and can be used for a
  diverse range of species, habitats and sites (Department of Planning 2020).
  The distance between traverses should be driven by the life form or habit of
  the target plant species and by the habitat. The length of the field traverses
  will depend on the area and the shape of the suitable habitat to be surveyed
  (Department of Planning 2020). Many threatened plant species have patchy
  distributions, low population sizes and cryptic habits, therefore, survey
  effort generally needs to be high to ensure that all areas of suitable habitat
  have been adequately surveyed. Additionally, as plants are sessile, the
  probability of detection usually depends on the total time searched (in the
  appropriate season), rather than the number of visits (Department of Planning
  2020). Once a target plant population has been identified, on-going monitoring
  may involve tracking growth, survivorship and life-stages of the individuals
  present (see the <em><a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/4f0f0ca4-d8f7-472d-9203-f46a565ad970">Recruitment</a></em> module for more details), as well as
  monitoring changes in population size or extent (Lindenmayer et al. 2020,
  Turner et al. 2020).

<p>
  An ecological community (EC) is a naturally occurring group of native plants,
  animals and other organisms, with the structure, composition and distribution
  determined by environmental factors such as soil type, position in the
  landscape, altitude, climate and water availability (DAWE 2021d). Communities
  are listed as threatened ecological communities (TECs), when the composition
  and function of the community has been severely depleted across its range, due
  to a number of reasons including clearing of native vegetation, inappropriate
  fire regimes, non-native or invasive species, climate change, water diversion,
  pollution and urban development (DAWE 2021a). The survey for ECs is similar to
  targeted flora surveys, and consists of active searches to determine the
  presence and extent of the target ECs (Environmental Protection Authority
  2016a). On-going monitoring can be used to track changes in condition and
  extent of any TECs identified and assess threats or the effectiveness of
  interventions (Lindenmayer et al. 2020). The EC protocol in this module has
  been designed for the collection of data on TECs listed under the EPBC Act,
  and can be used in combination with other modules, including
