      To start a new survey, select the New Survey box and then select either
      flora, fauna or ecological community button to select the type of survey
      that will be undertaken (multiple survey types can be undertaken by
      returning to this page between surveys).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select Return to Survey, if a survey has been started, and needs to be
      revisited to check traps or collect equipment (only applicable to passive
      fauna surveys), or Repeat Survey if survey is a revisit (i.e. in a
      different season or year). This will bring up a list of surveys, which the
      current survey can be linked to (record any details relevant to the
      current survey in the Survey Details fields).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check the box if multiple users are completing the survey using separate
      apps, as this will allow tracks and observations to be recorded on
      multiple devices.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If required, the survey area can be defined by clicking on the Add Area
      icon and creating a polygon around the target area to help systematically
      cover the area (optional). This boundary will be shown in the mapping
      interface.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record general survey details, including survey objectives, weather
      conditions (see Appendix 3), observer details and experience, survey
      objectives and design, habitat or areas targeted.

  <li>
    <p>
      Select Start Survey to continue to the targeted fauna, flora or ecological
      community survey screens. Refer to Section 5 for fauna surveys, Section 6
      for flora surveys or Section 7 for Ecological Community surveys.

<p><strong>Additional guidelines</strong></p>
<p style="color: orange">Survey type</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Targeted surveys can be undertaken for fauna, flora or ecological
      communities. If the project requires targeted surveys for more than one of
      these groups (i.e., targeted fauna and targeted flora), complete one
      survey (or survey set up), return to the main app screen and add
      additional surveys (each survey will be given a unique ID).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Multiple targeted surveys may be required if more than one species or
      community is assessed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Targeted flora surveys can be undertaken for vascular or non-vascular
      species.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Targeted fauna surveys can be undertaken for vertebrate or invertebrate
      species.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ecological community surveys are focussed on the communities listed as
      threatened under the EPBC Act but can also be applied to other communities
      (enter community name manually).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the same or similar methods are being used (i.e., pitfall and Elliott
      trapping), multiple species or communities can be surveyed using a single
      survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Multiple species or communities should only be surveyed for at the same
      time, if they have a similar biology (i.e., all trees) or if the same (or
      similar) methods are being used (i.e., pitfall and Elliott trapping for
      small mammals and reptiles).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the same survey method is being applied at several locations across a
      project area, each of these unique locations should be recorded as a
      separate survey.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Weather conditions</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The weather conditions at the time of the survey can contribute to survey
      effectiveness and outcomes (refer to Appendix 3 for more detailed
      information about each of the weather fields).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Weather conditions can change over the course of the survey, so it is
      recommended that weather information is collected at the start of each
      survey, and for multi-day surveys, at least once a day.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If multiple surveys are undertaken on the same day, the app will pre-fill
      the weather information for efficiency based on the results of the
      previous survey, but these values need to be checked and updated when
      necessary.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Survey details</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The survey details sections have been developed to collect a range of
      other general information about the survey, including observers and the
      level of experience, how and why the survey was designed, what references
      the survey is based on (i.e. EPBC survey guidelines), and any specific
      areas or habitat types being targeted or excluded from survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter the names of any observers involved in the survey and their level of
      experience. Include any relevant experience surveying the target taxa.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Survey objectives include why the survey is being undertaken, what is
      being targeted and why, if it is part of any on-going monitoring programs
      or associated with an intervention or development.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Survey design and justification include any details on the field survey
      methods being implemented (i.e. combination of methods used), what the
      survey design is based on (e.g. EPBC survey guidelines, scientific paper)
      and what is being targeted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Users can also specify how the survey area has been stratified or if any
      particular habitats or areas are being targeted for the survey or
      excluded, and if so, why this is the case.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The survey area can be defined by adding or uploading a polygon. This will
      be shown in the mapping interface to assist with navigation around the
      area and to ensure that all target sites have been adequately sampled.
