<ol start="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      To record details of a population, select the Add Population option from
      the Targeted Flora screen.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Mark the boundary of the population by standing at the population edge and
      selecting Add Vertex. Continue this process as you make your way around
      the population, selecting Add Vertex as often as required to accurately
      mark the edge.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once the boundary has been defined, select Save and Continue to move onto
      the next screen to record details about the populaton and collect any
      voucher specimens if required.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The date, time and the location of the observation will be automatically
      recorded.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the Observer from the drop-down list (pre-populated based on entry
      of surveyor details during project setup).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the Number of individuals observed (zero, blank and no selection
      are invalid). Select if the count is exact or an estimate (for large
      populations samples can be used to estimate population size. Exact counts
      tend to be reliable up to ca. 50 individuals, depending on plant type).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Fill in all of the required fields, including a description of the habitat
      and any other observations about the population (free text).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the growth-forms, growth-stages and life-stages present (multiple
      can be selected from the drop-down list).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record any health factors (mistletoes, insect damage etc) from the
      drop-down list (multiple can be selected and these align with the
      condition module).
