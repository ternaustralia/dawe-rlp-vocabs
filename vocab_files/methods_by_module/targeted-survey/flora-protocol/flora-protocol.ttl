  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is helpful to obtain a list of species that may be encountered during
      your study. This enables you to plan what species to target, what survey
      techniques are likely to be most suitable and to become familiar with
      identifying the species that may be encountered. Sources of such
      information include literature, experts, naturalist groups and databases
      (Department of Parks and Wildlife 2013).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Key resources: EPBC Protected Matters Search, state/territory databases,
      Atlas of Living Australia. Note: consider the data source and reliability
      of the information.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Previous records can give an indication of suitable habitat types within
      the project area. Check the dates and reliability of any records.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Determine the extent (including spatial resolution, and temporal scale) of
      previous survey work in the area, including the numbers and localities of
      any herbarium and museum specimens previously registered from the project
      area and surrounds. Key resources: state/territory databases, TERN, Atlas
      of Living Australia, biological survey reports, data requests.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consult other institutions/experts/researchers where appropriate,
      regarding any project or species-specific survey requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obtain advice from the relevant herbarium regarding:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            species of interest for vouchering (thus avoiding unnecessary collecting)

      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Field survey</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Observations can only be recorded against species defined in the target
      species list (5 species maximum). If other species are detected, these can
      be recorded using the Opportune module.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Surveys should be undertaken when the target species are most detectable
      and identifiable in the field, i.e. during the relevant flowering/fruiting
      time for each species), which may mean multiple surveys are required to
      cover the flowering periods of the species of interest (Environmental
      Protection Authority 2016a).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To ensure detectability is not compromised it is recommended that
      multi-species searches be restricted to a maximum of five species in the
      same stratum (Department of Planning 2020). If more than five species are
      being targeted, or target species have different life forms, undertake
      multiple surveys. The Opportune module should be used to record
      observations of non-target species, even if they are observed during a
      targeted survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Searching for threatened plant species is more reliable on clear days with
      little or no wind or rain (Department of Planning 2020).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Factors that can influence search timing include light, bad weather, wet
      grass, steep slopes and time of the day.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Very dense vegetation can significantly increase the time require for
      traverses or meanders.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As a general rule, threatened species surveys should not be undertaken
      during drought, following periods of disturbance (unless the species
      requires disturbance) or other adverse environmental conditions that
      affect species detectability (Department of Planning 2020), unless the aim
      of the project is the monitor these impacts.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A threatened plant species must be identified to species level and
      submitted to a registered herbarium for inspection and formal
      identification (Department of Planning 2020). However, see additional
      guidelines below for collecting vouchers and where possible, collect photo
      evidence instead of physical vouchers, especially where physical
      collection may influence population viability (i.e. for very small
      populations, or small plants).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Each habitat type in the project area should be surveyed, not just those
      that are known habitat for threatened or near threatened species
      (Department of Environment and Science 2020), but survey effort can be
      tailored, so known habitats receive a greater survey effort than more
      marginal habitats, if species requirements are well understood.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where a target species is identified in the field, the population extent
      and population size (or density) needs to be determined. In high density
      areas, the number of individuals that make up the population can be
      estimated based on the number of individuals within a sub-plot(s)
      (Department of Environment and Science 2020).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The number of individuals along with other observations, such as age class
      structure, reproductive state and health should also be recorded
      (Department of Environment and Science 2020).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter all required fields in the App (a warning message will appear when
      attempting to save the record if required fields are not entered). Refer
      to the information buttons in the App for clarification regarding the data
      collection and entry requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be as accurate as possible with recording the location of the record. This
      is most important for species that have some significance (e.g. threatened
      species, invasive species, unknown species, range extension). Ensure that
      the Trimble® R1 is on, with high accuracy before recording any
      observations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Include a scale card or something for scale (e.g. pencil) in photos (refer
      to the supporting information at the end of this module for examples).
      Multiple photos can be taken to record different parts of the plant,
      including flowers, leaves, bark, buds etc. Ensure that each photo is
      labelled with a short description.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Disturbance impacts should be minimised. Avoid trampling on native
      vegetation, especially in areas where targeted surveys overlap with plots
      or sensitive habitats.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Active searching</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      A GPS track log will be recorded to show the location and extent of field
      traverses. This will demonstrate that the survey has been systematic and
      comprehensive.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In areas of preferred habitat for threatened species, an area can be
      searched using the meander technique. This allows for greater coverage of
      areas than plot-based surveys and is less time consuming. It involves
      traversing areas of suitable habitat in no set pattern, but roughly back
      and forth, whilst searching for a particular, or several, threatened plant
      species (Department of Environment and Conservation 2004).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Methods should be used consistently and be recorded and mapped in
      sufficient detail to allow replication (Department of Environment and
      Conservation 2004).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Field data collection is needed to document the number of individuals
      and/or the area of habitat for each target threatened species location
      during the survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Generally, species assessed via direct counts are long-lived plants that
      persist above ground, where the population size can be readily assessed.
      Species assessed by area are generally cryptic, clonal, logistically
      difficult to survey or cannot be reliably counted (Department of Planning
      2020).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Small groups of individuals (e.g. &lt;50 plants) can be counted with
      reasonable confidence; however, for larger populations, extrapolating the
      mean density by sampling over the areas of occupancy may be required.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It is good practice to temporarily mark individuals with removable survey
      pins or flagging tape if populations are going to be returned to for
      counts and to avoid double-counting.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Voucher collection</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      See the Floristics module for more information about collecting vouchers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Collection of flora vouchers of rare, threatened or endangered species
      should only be made when such actions would not jeopardise the continued
      existence of the population. Collection of threatened species may require
      additional information to be obtained to fulfil permitting requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Vouchers should only be collected if the relevant permits and approvals
      have been obtained.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Seek advice from the relevant herbarium regarding collection, preservation
      and labelling requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In the absence of a voucher specimen, photo evidence can help to validate
      the record.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When dealing with multiple voucher specimens from the same observation,
      each specimen is given a unique, sequential barcode. Take care to ensure
      the correct barcode is assigned.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If collecting a voucher specimen would jeopardise the continued existence
      of a rare, threatened or endangered flora population, the following can
      serve as the required voucher (listed in decreasing order of preference):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Portion of fertile plant without the root.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Photos of plant in conjunction with piece of fertile plant or plant parts
            (leaves and flowers or fruits).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Photos of fertile plant in conjunction with sterile plant specimen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Sterile plant specimen only, or photos only (preferably with descriptive
            notes).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Where possible, a voucher should include enough material to cover an A3
      size herbarium sheet. Specific procedures and guidelines to collect,
      prepare, label and store flora voucher specimens are provided in the
      Floristics module and via the information buttons in the App. Also refer
      to the advice provided by the relevant herbarium. Refer to the Plant
      tissue vouchering module for procedures and guidelines to collect and
      store leaf samples for DNA and isotope analysis.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Tag each specimen securely with a unique voucher barcode label. Place the
      label on stems or away from any plant parts that will need to be examined
      for identification purposes. Use paper envelopes for small specimens and
      attach the voucher label to the envelope.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      After labelling, place larger flora specimens directly into a plastic bag,
      and smaller flora specimens into paper bags, then the plastic bag, ready
      for transferring to a plant press.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Place the voucher specimens in a plant press in the field, preferably
      before commencing another module. To avoid confusion, it is best to place
      targeted records in a separate plant press to that used for the plot
      survey samples.
