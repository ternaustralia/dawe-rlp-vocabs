<ol start="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      The date, time and the location of the observation will be automatically
      recorded.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the Observer from the drop-down list (pre-populated based on entry
      of surveyor details during project setup).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record the Number of individuals observed (zero, blank and no selection
      are invalid). Select if the count is exact or an estimate (for large or
      dispersed populations, record using the Add Population function).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Record any additional Observation notes (optional).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record Habitat description using the drop-down lists or manual entry (e.g.
      structural formation, vegetation association, macro and microhabitat).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record Growth form, Growth stage, Life stage and Health using the
      drop-down lists (see Appendix 8 for details).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record plant size details, including DBH, height and width (optional, only
      use for individuals).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Click on the Camera icon to open your devices camera and take a photo of
      the individual. Multiple photos can be taken to record different elements
      of the plant, including growth form, leaves and flowers. Ensure that
      photos are labelled with details of what has been captured and a scale
      card is visible.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a voucher specimen is collected, select the Add voucher button. Assign
      a unique barcode voucher label to the specimen and scan barcode (see
      Floristics module for instructions).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If more than one voucher specimen is collected for the same observation
      (e.g. a plant voucher and a plant tissue voucher) then select toggle ‘on’
      for Additional voucher specimen and repeat Step 17. Each specimen is
      allocated a unique barcode.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select Save to save the species record and return to the Targeted Flora
      overview screen, where the survey can be continued and more observations
      recorded, until the entire area has been survey, or the survey can be
      finalised.

<ol start="12&quot;">
  <li>
    <p>
      If areas of potential habitat are identified during the survey, select the
      Add potential habitat option. This option will generally be most
      appropriate for annual or cryptic species that may be difficult to
      identify during active searches.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select the target species that the habitat is suitable for from the
      drop-down list. The list will include any species selected as target
      species at the beginning of the survey.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Record a description of the habitat and why it is deemed suitable for the
      species (free-text).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Take a photo of the suitable habitat. Multiple photos can be taken to
      document different characteristics of the area. Ensure each photo is
      labelled with a short description.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Mark the boundary of the habitat by standing at the population edge and
      selecting Add Vertex. Continue this process as you make your way around
      the area of suitable habitat, selecting Add Vertex as often as required to
      accurately mark the edge. See Appendix 6 for details about recording
      habitat boundaries.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once the boundary has been defined, select Finish sketch to return to the
      main screen and continue the survey.
