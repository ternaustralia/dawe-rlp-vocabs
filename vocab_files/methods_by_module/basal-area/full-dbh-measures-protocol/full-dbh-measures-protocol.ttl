      It may be beneficial to undertake this module while the transects for the
      point-intercept measures in the <a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover module</a> (5 N/S and 5 E/W; see Figure 1)
      are laid out. The transects can help to partition the plot into more
      manageable subplots that can be surveyed systematically. This will be
      particularly helpful in dense plots.
    </li>
    <li>
      Coloured survey pins can alternatively be used to partition the plot into
      more manageable subplots.
    </li>
    <li>Clearly mark the measuring pole at 1.3 m to easily locate the POM.</li>
    <li>
      If a measuring pole is not available, use the normal side of the diameter
      tape (i.e. the side of the tape with 1 cm increments) or a regular tape to
      locate the POM. Mark the tape at 1.3 m to easily locate the POM.
    </li>
    <li>
      Loose litter and debris at the base of the tree should be brushed aside
      before determining the POM.
    </li>
    <li>
      The metal tip, a push pin or thumb tack can be used to hold the end of the
      diameter or regular tape in place while pulling the tape around the trunk or
      stem at the POM.
    </li>
    <li>
      The rule set to determine if a tree is in or out of the plot is illustrated in Figure 5. A tree is in the plot if more than 50% of the base of the
      trunk is within the plot.

  <p><strong>Solutions to problem trees</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Solutions to measuring DBH for problem trees are illustrated in Figure 6.
    </li>
    <li>
      Buttressed trees are a significant source of error in repeat tree
      measurements and require careful attention in the field. Buttressed trees
      are measured at 1.3 m, at the highest point you can reach (e.g.,
      approximately 2.2 m) and 50 cm above the top of the buttress. Every effort
      must be made for both the 1.3 m and the highest point you can reach during
      initial surveys.
    </li>
    <li>
      Multi-stemmed trees are treated as single trees with multiple stems (Stem A,
      B, C, etc.). Record measurements for each individual stem.
    </li>
    <li>
      For trees on a slope, the 1.3 m POM should be measured on the uphill side of
      the tree.
    </li>
    <li>
      Leaning trees should be measured on the inside of the lean, starting at the
      ground next to the base of the tree.
    </li>
    <li>
      Deformed trees should be measured either above or below 1.3 m and the POM
      recorded.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dead trees in a baseline survey are flagged as &lsquo;Dead&rsquo; and all
      other attributes are measured as normal.
    </li>
    <li>
      The soft texture of tree fern trunks is not conducive to DBH measurements
      and therefore tree ferns are not measured for diameter.

    <ol>
      <li>Ensure the <a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot selection and layout module</a> has been completed to mark out the plot grid with very high accuracy using the Trimble&reg; R1.</li>
      <li>If the plot contains dense trees, tall shrubs and/or mallee, use the transects laid out for the <a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover module</a> to delineate the plot into subplots and simplify DBH measures. Alternatively, use coloured survey pins.</li>
      <li>Open the App and navigate to the &lsquo;Basal Area&rsquo; module and then the &lsquo;Full DBH Measures Protocol&rsquo;.</li>
      <li>Select the instrument you are using to measure DBH, either a diameter tape, regular tape or tree caliper.</li>
      <li>Move through the plot systematically in a &lsquo;zig zag&rsquo; pattern and search for trees, tall shrubs and mallee greater than 2 m in height with a DBH &ge;10 cm.</li>
      <li>For each tree, tall shrub or mallee with a DBH &ge;10 cm encountered, press the &lsquo;Add tree&rsquo; button.</li>
      <li>Record the species name or assigned field name if the species name is unknown (see the <a href="https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewers/dawe-vocabs?uri=https://linked.data.gov.au/def/test/dawe-cv/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics module</a>). Flag if the tree is 'dead' using the checkbox.</li>
      <li>Use the measuring pole pushed firmly into the ground to locate the 1.3 m point of measurement (POM), or suitable POM for problem trees, see Additional guidelines).</li>
      <li>If using a diameter or regular tape, pull the tape around the trunk or stem at the POM so that it is perpendicular to the main axis of the trunk or stem, rather than parallel to the ground (provides an accurate measurement of leaning trees, see Additional guidelines). Clear any moss, loose bark, or anything that may distort the tape.</li>
      <li>If using a diameter tape, record the diameter and POM (default is 1.3 m update for problem trees, see Additional guidelines) in meters.</li>
      <li>If using a regular tape, record the circumference and POM (default is 1.3 m update for problem trees, see Additional guidelines) in meters. The App will automatically calculate and display the diameter.</li>
      <li>If using a tree caliper, record the diameter and POM (default is 1.3 m update for problem trees, see Additional guidelines) in meters. Close the caliper around the trunk or stem at the POM so that it is perpendicular to the main axis of the trunk or stem, rather than parallel to the ground (provides an accurate measurement of leaning trees, see Additional guidelines). Clear any moss, loose bark, or anything that may prevent closing the caliper fully.</li>
      <li>If the trunk or stem is shaped as an ellipse when using a tree caliper, check the &lsquo;Ellipse&rsquo; checkbox and record a second diameter measurement at a 90&deg; angle to the first diameter measurement to account for the ellipse. The App will automatically calculate the square root of the product of the two diameters to determine the measure of trunk or stem diameter.</li>
      <li>If the tree is multi-stemmed, check the &lsquo;multi-stemmed tree&rsquo; checkbox. The App will display the stem identifier (Stem B, C, etc.), &lsquo;Diameter&rsquo; and &lsquo;POM&rsquo; fields and a &lsquo;Save stem&rsquo; button. Record and save the diameter and POM for each individual stem. If any stems are shaped as an ellipse when using a tree caliper, refer to 'step 13'.</li>
      <li>If the tree is buttressed, check the &lsquo;Buttressed tree&rsquo; checkbox. Additional to the &lsquo;Breast height&rsquo; measurement, the App will display &lsquo;Diameter&rsquo; and &lsquo;POM&rsquo; fields for &lsquo;Reach point&rsquo; (i.e., the highest point that you can reach, approximately 2.2 m) and &rsquo;50 cm above buttress&rsquo; (i.e., 50 cm above the top of the buttress) measurements. Record the diameter and POM for each measurement. If the trunk or stem is shaped as an ellipse when using a tree caliper, refer to 'step 13'.</li>
      <li>Select the &lsquo;Save tree&rsquo; button.</li>
      <li>Repeat 'steps 6&ndash;16' for every tree, tall shrub and/or mallee greater than 2 m in height with a DBH &ge;10 cm within the plot.</li>
      <li>When all trees within the plot have been measured, select the &lsquo;Finish module&rsquo; button to return to the module selection screen.</li>
