    DBH measures for all trees (trees, tall shrubs and/or mallee greater than 2 m in height with a DBH ≥10 cm) within the plot.
    This module serves as a sub-protocol of the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f7e0d965-ae73-434e-8599-634598e506b5">Basal Area</a> module. 
    Prior to implementing this protocol, it is essential to thoroughly review the Introduction, Key Definitions and Terminology,
    Rationale, and Module Overview provided in the "<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f7e0d965-ae73-434e-8599-634598e506b5">Basal Area</a>" module.
    These sections will provide you with important contextual information and a comprehensive understanding of the protocol.

<h2 id="field-collection">Field collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plot must be established using the Plot Layout and Selection
Module prior to conducting the DBH protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>The Plot Description Module must be completed prior to or during
the reconnaissance survey using the active search protocol.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey activity time will vary depending on the options chosen and
the density of vegetation to traverse. A tree survey highly depends on
the number of trees to measure. As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1 - 2 hours for survey planning</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20 - 40 minutes for plot set-up and laying tape measures
(assuming the plot has been previously set-up using the Plot Selection
and Layout Module).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 1 – 4 hours to complete the Enhanced protocol</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 30 minutes to 2 hours to complete the Standard protocol for
each subplot.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Basal area DBH measurements are best conducted with two
personnel, one taking measurements and one recording the data directly
into the Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor making observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying traits specific to tree species and how to
distinguish different species from one another.</p></li>
<li><p>Basal area DBH measurements do not involve interference with
wildlife. Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals
are unlikely to be required but remember to always check with the local
authority. Access permissions are required.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>It may be beneficial to undertake this module while the transects
for the point-intercept measures in the Cover Module (5 N/S and 5 E/W;
see <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1.</a>) are laid out. The transects can help to partition the
plot into more manageable units that can be surveyed systematically.
Alternatively, use coloured survey pins to divide the plot. This will be
particularly helpful in dense plots.</p></li>
<li><p>When recording a new tree using the <em>add tree</em> button,
ensure that the app operator is standing as near to the tree as possible
as the tree as the location is recorded with this action.</p></li>
<li><p>Chalk that is light coloured such as pink and purple show up best
when marking trees.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly mark the measuring pole at 1.3 m to easily locate the
POM.</p></li>
<li><p>If a measuring pole is not available, use the normal side of the
diameter tape (i.e. the side of the tape with 1 cm increments) or a
regular measuring tape to locate the POM. Mark the tape at 1.3 m to
easily locate the POM.</p></li>
<li><p>Loose litter and debris at the base of the tree should be brushed
aside before determining the POM.</p></li>
<li><p>The rule set to determine if a tree is in or out of the plot is
illustrated in Figure 4. A tree is in the plot if more than 50% of the
base of the trunk is within the plot.</p></li>
<li><p>A rigid tape measure is accurate for measuring the circumference
of smaller trees (~50 cm DBH) and where there is loose bark.</p></li>
<li><p>For mallee or mulga trees that branch into multiple stems below
1.3 m it is recommended to take diameter measurements at 30 cm from the
ground or if branching lower than this at 10 cm and record the POM as
such.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="solutions-to-problem-trees">Solutions to
problem trees</h4>
<p>The solutions to measuring DBH for problem trees are illustrated in
<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Trees on a slope (Figure 3.a), 1.3 m should be measured on the
uphill side of the tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Leaning trees (Figure 3.c) should be measured on the inside of
the lean, starting at the ground next to the base of the tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-stemmed trees (Figure 3.d and e) are treated as single
trees with multiple stems (Stem A, B, C, etc.). A single DBH is recorded
if the tree branches above 1.3 m (d), otherwise, each individual stem is
measured (e).</p></li>
<li><p>Mallee or Mulga (Figure 3.f) that branch very close to the ground
should be measured at 30 cm or if branching lower than this, 10 cm and
POM recorded accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>Deformed trees (Figure 3.g and h) should be measured either above
or below 1.3 m and the POM recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>Buttressed trees (Figure 3.i) are a significant source of error
in repeat tree measurements and require careful attention in the field.
Buttressed trees are measured at 1.3 m, at the highest point you can
reach (e.g. approximately 2.2 m) and 50 cm above the top of the
buttress. Every effort must be made for both the 1.3 m and the highest
point you can reach during initial surveys.</p></li>
<li><p>Dead trees in a baseline survey are flagged as <em>dead,</em> and
all other attributes are measured as normal.</p></li>
<li>The soft texture of tree fern
trunks is not conducive to DBH measurements and therefore, tree ferns
are not measured for diameter.</li>

<li><p>Open the app and navigate to the Basal Area Module and select the

diameter tape, regular measuring tape or tree caliper.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm the start date and time and select
<em>next.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Move through the plot section by section, systematically
searching for trees, tall shrubs and mallee greater than 2 m in height
and with a DBH ≥10 cm (or 5 cm for mallee and mulga dominated
sites).</p></li>
<li><p>For each tree encountered, select <em>add tree</em> and
record:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>The species name or assigned field name if the species name is
unknown (see Floristics Module). If the tree is dead, record the species
name as ‘dead tree’.</p></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The app will display stem labels (Stem 1, Stem 2, Stem 3
etc.).</p></li>

complete step 9 for each individual stem before proceeding to step
10.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If the tree is buttressed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The app will require the input of the diameter and POM of the
tree at its reach point (the highest point you can reach - approximately
2.2 m) and the diameter and POM of the tree at 50 cm above the buttress.
If you cannot measure 50 cm above the buttress record ‘not collected’ in
the diameter field.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>For each tree, then locate the 1.3 m point of measurement (POM)
(see note below) and:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Clear any moss, loose bark or other material that may distort the
measurement and measure the diameter of the tree at the POM.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If using a diameter tape, measure the diameter of the tree (in
centimetres) by pulling the diameter tape around the trunk or stem at
the POM perpendicular to the main axis of the trunk or stem.</p></li>
<li><p>If using a 5-10 m measuring tape, record the circumference of the
trunk or stem (in centimetres) at the POM. The app will automatically
calculate and display the diameter measurement in the field
below.</p></li>
<li><p>If using a tree caliper, close the caliper around the trunk or
stem at the POM so that it is perpendicular to the main axis of the
trunk or stem, rather than parallel to the ground (this provides an
accurate measurement of leaning trees). Record the diameter in
centimetres.</p></li>
<li><p>If when using the tree caliper to measure, the trunk or stem is
an ellipse shape, check the <em>ellipse</em> checkbox and record a
second diameter measurement at a 90° angle to the first diameter
measurement to account for the ellipse. The app will automatically
calculate the square root of the product of the two diameters to
determine the measure of trunk or stem diameter and display the diameter
measurement in the <em>calculated DBH</em> field below.</p></li>
