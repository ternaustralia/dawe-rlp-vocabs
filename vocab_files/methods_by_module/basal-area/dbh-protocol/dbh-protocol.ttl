<h2 id="field-collection">Field Collection</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Pre-requisites for completing this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plot must be established using the Plot Layout and Selection
Module prior to conducting the DBH protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Undertake the Floristics Module to ensure consistency with flora
species identifications/assigned field names.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey activity time will vary depending on the options chosen, the
density of vegetation to traverse, the number of trees to measure and
the number and experience of personnel. As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1–2 hours for survey planning.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20–40 minutes for plot set-up and laying tape measures
(assuming the plot has been previously set-up using the Plot Selection
and Layout Module).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 1–4 hours to complete the Enhanced protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 0.5–2 hours to complete the Standard protocol.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Basal area DBH measurements are best conducted with two
personnel, one taking measurements and one recording data directly into
the Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor making observations should be familiar with, and
experienced in, species identification and differentiating between
species.</p></li>
<li><p>Basal area DBH measurements do not involve interference with
vegetation or wildlife. Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife
ethics approvals are unlikely to be required but always check with the
local authority. Access permissions are required.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>It may be beneficial to undertake this module while the transects
for the point-intercept measures in the Cover Module (5 N/S and 5 E/W;
see <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>) are laid out. The transects can help to partition the plot
into more manageable units that can be surveyed systematically.
Alternatively, use coloured survey pins to divide the plot. This will be
particularly helpful in dense plots.</p></li>
<li><p>When recording a new tree using the <em>add tree</em> button,
ensure that the app operator is standing as near to the tree as possible
as the tree location is recorded with this action.</p></li>
<li><p>Chalk that is light coloured such as pink and purple show up best
when marking trees.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly mark the measuring pole at 1.3 m to easily locate the
POM.</p></li>
<li><p>If a measuring pole is not available, use the normal side of the
diameter tape (i.e. the side of the tape with 1 cm increments) or a
regular measuring tape to locate the POM. Mark the tape at 1.3 m to
easily locate the POM.</p></li>
<li><p>Loose litter and debris at the base of the tree should be brushed
aside before determining the POM.</p></li>
<li><p>The rule set to determine if a tree is in or out of the plot is
illustrated in <a href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a>. A tree is in the plot if more than 50% of the
base of the trunk is within the plot.</p></li>
<li><p>A rigid tape measure is accurate for measuring the circumference
of smaller trees (~50 cm DBH) and where there is loose bark.</p></li>
<li><p>For mallee or mulga trees that branch into multiple stems below
1.3 m it is recommended to take diameter measurements at 30 cm from the
ground or if branching lower than this at 10 cm and record the POM as
such.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="solutions-to-problem-trees">Solutions to
problem trees</h4>
<p>The solutions to measuring DBH for problem trees are illustrated in
    <a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Trees on a slope (<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3a</a>), 1.3 m should be measured on the
uphill side of the tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Leaning trees (<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3b</a>) should be measured on the inside of the
lean, starting at the ground next to the base of the tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-stemmed trees (<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3d</a> and <a href="#figure-3">Figure 3e</a>) are treated as single trees
with multiple stems (Stem 1, 2, 3, etc.). A single DBH is recorded if
the tree branches above 1.3 m (d), otherwise, each individual stem is
measured (e).</p></li>
<li><p>Mallee or mulga (<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3f</a>) that branch very close to the ground
should be measured at 30 cm or if branching lower than this, 10 cm and
POM recorded accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>Deformed trees (<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3g</a> and <a href="#figure-3">Figure 3h</a>) should be measured either above
or below 1.3 m and the POM recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>Buttressed trees (<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3i</a>) are a significant source of error in
repeat tree measurements and require careful attention in the field.
Buttressed trees are measured at 1.3 m, at the highest point you can
reach (e.g. approximately 2.2 m) and 50 cm above the top of the
buttress. Every effort must be made for both the 1.3 m and the highest
point you can reach during initial surveys.</p></li>
<li><p>Dead trees in a baseline survey are flagged as <em>dead,</em> and
all other attributes are measured as normal.</p></li>
<li>The soft texture of tree fern
trunks is not conducive to DBH measurements and therefore, tree ferns
are not measured for diameter.</p></li>

    <h3 id="instructions-and-procedures">Instructions and Procedures</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ensure the Plot Selection and Layout Module has been completed to
mark out the plot boundary and define the current plot and visit in the
Monitor App.</p></li>
<li><p>Survey area is determined by the protocol being
undertaken:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>If completing the Standard DBH protocol use the transects laid
out for the Cover Module to delineate the 40 x 40 m sub-plot, between
the N/S2 and N/S4, and E/W2 and E/W4 point-intercept transects (see
<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>). This 40 x 40 m sub-plot will be the survey area.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If completing the Enhanced DBH protocol and the plot contains
dense trees, tall shrubs and/or mallee, use the transects laid out for
the Cover Module to partition the plot into smaller units.
Alternatively, use coloured survey pins. The 100 x 100 m plot will be
the survey area.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Open the Monitor app and navigate to the Basal Area Module and
then the DBH protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the relevant <em>plot size</em> for the project. Steps
5–13 are the same whether completing the Enhanced or Standard DBH
protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>DBH instrument</em> you are using to
measure DBH, either a diameter tape, tape measure or tree
caliper.</p></li>
<li><p>Move through the plot section by section, systematically
searching for trees, tall shrubs and mallee greater than 2 m in height
and with a DBH ≥10 cm (or 5 cm for mallee and mulga dominated
sites).</p></li>
<li><p>For each tree encountered, select <em>add tree</em> and
record:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>floristics voucher</em> (i.e. the field name recorded for
the species in the Floristics Module). If the tree is dead, leave the
<em>floristics voucher</em> field blank and flag the tree as
‘dead’.</p></li>
<li><p>If the tree is multi-stemmed, check the box:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The app will display stem labels (Stem 1, Stem 2, Stem 3,
etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Add additional stems by selecting the add button and complete
step 8 for each individual stem.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If the tree is buttressed, check the box:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The app will require the input of the diameter and POM of the
tree at its reach point (the highest point you can reach - approximately
2.2 m) and the diameter and POM of the tree at 50 cm above the buttress.
If you cannot measure 50 cm above the buttress record ‘not collected’ in
the diameter field.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p>For each tree/stem, then locate the 1.3 m point of measurement
(POM) (see note below) and:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Clear any moss, loose bark or other material that may distort the
measurement and measure the diameter of the tree at the POM.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If using a diameter tape, measure the diameter of the tree (in
centimetres) by pulling the diameter tape around the trunk or stem at
the POM perpendicular to the main axis of the trunk or stem.</p></li>
<li><p>If using a 5–10 m measuring tape, record the circumference of the
trunk or stem (in centimetres) at the POM. The app will automatically
calculate and display the diameter measurement in the DBH
field.</p></li>
<li><p>If using a tree caliper, close the caliper around the trunk or
stem at the POM so that it is perpendicular to the main axis of the
trunk or stem, rather than parallel to the ground (this provides an
accurate measurement of leaning trees). Record the diameter in
centimetres.</p></li>
<li><p>If when using the tree caliper to measure, the trunk or stem is
an ellipse shape, check the <em>ellipse</em> checkbox and record a
second diameter measurement at a 90° angle to the first diameter
measurement to account for the ellipse. The app will automatically
calculate the square root of the product of the two diameters to
determine the measure of trunk or stem diameter and display the diameter
measurement in the <em>calculated DBH</em> field.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Note: use the 1.3 m POM, or suitable POM for problem trees (see
<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>Date and time will be automatically recorded. Update if required
and save the observation.</p></li>
<li><p>Once measured, mark the tree or stem with chalk to avoid
remeasuring.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 7–10 for every tree within the plot or
sub-plot.</p></li>
<li><p>When all trees have been measured, queue the collection for
submission.</p></li>
