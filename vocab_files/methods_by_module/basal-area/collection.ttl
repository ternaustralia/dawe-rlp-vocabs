  Module overview This module covers the procedures and guidelines of three
  protocols for recording basal area within plots where there is a dominant
  growth form of trees, shrubs and/or mallee greater than 2 m in height:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  1. Full DBH measures protocol &ndash; DBH measures for all trees (trees, tall
  shrubs and/or mallee greater than 2 m in height with a DBH &ge;10 cm) within
  the plot.
</p>
<p>
  2. Lite DBH measures protocol &ndash; DBH measures for all trees (trees, tall
  shrubs and/or mallee greater than 2 m in height with a DBH &ge;10 cm) within
  two 20 x 100 m belt transects in the plot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  3. Basal wedge protocol &ndash; TERN Basal Wedge measures of &lsquo;in&rsquo;
  trees at nine point sampling locations across the plot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The full and lite DBH measures protocols include the procedures and guidelines
  for the collection of DBH measures for all trees within the plot and belt
  transects, respectively, including moving through the plot/belt transects
  systematically, determining the POM using a measuring pole, measuring the DBH
  using a diameter tape or tree caliper, and recording the data into the
  App.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The guidelines provide further information on dealing with problem trees and
  dense plots. The basal wedge protocol includes the procedures and guidelines
  for the collection of TERN Basal Wedge measures, including the location of the
  nine sampling points (NW, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW and W points around the
  perimeter of the plot, as well as the centre of the plot; see Figure 1),
  determining if the use of the basal wedge is warranted, using the basal wedge,
  establishing which BAF is appropriate for each species (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,
  1 and 2; see Figure 2), conducting a 360&deg; basal sweep, and recording the
  data into the App. The guidelines provide further information on the rules to
  determine &lsquo;in&rsquo;, &lsquo;out&rsquo; and &lsquo;borderline&rsquo;
  trees, and dealing with problem trees. The Basal Area module is linked to the
  following modules: &bull; Floristics &ndash; Basal area data per species are
  recorded using naming consistent with the flora species
  identifications/assigned field names recorded in the Floristics module.
  Therefore, the Basal Area module must be undertaken after the Floristics
  module. &bull; Cover &ndash; The transects laid out in the Cover module can be
  used simultaneously to delineate the two 20 x 100 m belt transects surveyed in
  the lite DBH measures protocol, as well as delineate the plot/belt transects
  into subplots, which can simplify sampling dense plots. Therefore, the Basal
  Area module should be undertaken at any time during plot monitoring while the
  transects for the Cover module are laid out. &bull; Photo-points &ndash; The
  three sets of overlapping panorama photographs collected in the Photopoints
  module can be processed using suitable algorithms to create a
  three-dimensional plot reconstruction, which can be used to measure trunk or
  stem diameters and calculate basal area. When software is readily available to
  run these algorithms, the Photo-points module will offer an additional method
  to measure of basal area and biomass.
