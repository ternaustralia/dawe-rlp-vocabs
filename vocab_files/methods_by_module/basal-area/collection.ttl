<h2 id="available-protocols">Available Protocols</h2>
<p>This module includes three protocols for recording basal area within
plots where there is a dominant growth form of trees, shrubs and/or
mallee greater than 2 m in height:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><a href="#dbh-protocol">Enhanced DBH Protocol</a> – Diameter at
breast height (DBH) measures for all trees (trees, tall shrubs and/or
mallee greater than 2 m in height with a DBH ≥10 cm or 5 cm for mallee
and mulga) within the plot (100 x 100 m).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#dbh-protocol">Standard DBH Protocol</a> –
DBH measures for all trees (trees, tall shrubs and/or mallee greater
than 2 m in height with a DBH ≥10 cm or 5 cm for mallee and mulga)
within a 40 x 40 m central subplot. If the Condition Module is being
undertaken, basal measures will be collected as part of the tree survey,
and do not need to be repeated here.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#basal-wedge-protocol">Basal Wedge Protocol</a> –TERN
Basal Wedge measures of ‘in’ trees at nine point-sampling locations
across the plot.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Enhanced and Standard DBH protocols include the procedures and
guidelines for the collection of DBH measures for all trees within the
plot and subplot, respectively, including moving through the plots
systematically, determining the Point of Measure (POM) using a measuring
pole, measuring the DBH using a diameter tape or tree caliper, and
recording the data into the app. The guidelines provide further
information on addressing problem trees and dense plots.</p>
<p>The Basal wedge protocol includes the procedures and guidelines for
the collection of TERN Basal Wedge measures, including the location of
the nine sampling points (NW, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW and W points around
the perimeter of the plot, as well as the centre of the plot; see Figure
1), determining if the use of the basal wedge is warranted, using the
basal wedge, establishing which basal area factor (BAF) is appropriate
for each species (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2; see Figure 2),
conducting a 360° basal sweep, and recording the data into the app. The
guidelines provide further information on the rules to determine ‘in’,
‘out’ and ‘borderline’ trees and dealing with problem trees.</p>

to delineate the 40 x 40 m subplot, as well as divide the plot and
subplot into smaller units, which can simplify sampling. It is
recommended that the Basal Area Module be completed at any time while
the transects for the Cover Module are laid out.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/05669173-2fe7-4b70-ba67-2e09fbe87de9">Photopoints Module</a> – three sets of overlapping panorama
photographs collected in the Photopoints Module can be processed using
suitable algorithms to create a three-dimensional plot reconstruction.
When software is readily available to run these algorithms, the
Photopoints Module will offer an additional method to extract data from
the panoramas, including basal area and biomass.</p></li>

<td>Allometric equations</td>
<td>Allometry studies the morphological, physiological and ecological
characteristics of organisms’ scale in relation to their size. In
forestry, allometric equations are used to estimate tree biomass as a
function of readily measurable characteristics, typically DBH and tree
height. The equations follow a variety of mathematical specifications
(e.g. log-linear, non-linear) and are derived based on measured values
of tree weight related to its DBH and height from sample trees.</td>

formed by the aperture of the sights on the TERN Basal Wedge and the
distance it is held from the observer’s eye.</td>
</tr>

<li><p>It may be beneficial to undertake this module while the transects
for the point-intercept measures in the Cover Module (5 N/S and 5 E/W;
see <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1.</a>) are laid out. The transects can help to partition the
plot into more manageable units that can be surveyed systematically.
Alternatively, use coloured survey pins to divide the plot. This will be
particularly helpful in dense plots.</p></li>

ensure that the app operator is standing as near to the tree as possible
as the tree as the location is recorded with this action.</p></li>

when marking trees.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly mark the measuring pole at 1.3 m to easily locate the

<li><p>If a measuring pole is not available, use the normal side of the
diameter tape (i.e. the side of the tape with 1 cm increments) or a
regular measuring tape to locate the POM. Mark the tape at 1.3 m to
easily locate the POM.</p></li>
<li><p>Loose litter and debris at the base of the tree should be brushed
aside before determining the POM.</p></li>
<li><p>The rule set to determine if a tree is in or out of the plot is
illustrated in <a href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a>. A tree is in the plot if more than 50% of the
base of the trunk is within the plot.</p></li>
<li><p>A rigid tape measure is accurate for measuring the circumference
of smaller trees (~50 cm DBH) and where there is loose bark.</p></li>
<li><p>For mallee or mulga trees that branch into multiple stems below
1.3 m it is recommended to take diameter measurements at 30 cm from the
ground or if branching lower than this at 10 cm and record the POM as
such.</p></li>

measured (e).</p></li>
<li><p>Mallee or Mulga (<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>.f) that branch very close to the ground

<p><span class="anchor" id="_Ref138703508"></span><h3>Appendix 1. Basal
wedge – point sampling explanation</h3></p>
<p>In point sampling, basal area is estimated based on the concept of
circles (trunks or stems) within circles (variable circular plots). The area of one circle varies proportionally to a change in
the area of the other circle (i.e. the area sampled is greater for
larger than smaller trees) and trees are sampled with a probability
proportional to their basal area. Therefore, large trees, which
contribute more to the basal area of a stand, are sampled in greater
proportions than small trees (Hovind and Rieck 1970).</p>
<p>An observer rotates 360° at a sampling point and counts all the
trunks or stems that form an angle greater than the chosen BAF. In
effect, every tree counted is sampled in a variable circular plot with a
radius that is a function of the tree’s DBH (<a href="#figure-7a">Figure 7a</a>). Because a
tree’s DBH determines its basal area, and the plot radius determines the
sampling area for that tree, the contribution of each counted tree to
total stand basal area can be determined. For such a sample of trees,
there is a constant relationship between tree DBH and effective sampling
area, and therefore each tree counted represents the same contribution
to the basal area of the stand. To estimate the total stand basal area,
the only calculation required is to multiply the count of ‘in’ trees by
the BAF used, which is determined from the aperture width used with an
angle gauge and the fixed distance that the angle gauge is held from the
eye (Fastie 2010). Measurements of variable circular plot radii and DBHs
are not required as these values are proportional to the aperture width
used with an angle gauge and the fixed distance that the angle gauge is
held from the eye (<a href="#figure-7b">Figure 7b</a>).</p>

<p>The Basal wedge protocol measures basal area at nine sampling points
(Figure 1) using a TERN Basal Wedge (Figure 2). The TERN Basal Wedge is
an angle gauge designed by TERN Ecosystem Surveillance for monitoring
basal areas across Australia. The hexagonal basal wedge has six fixed
angle gauges that represent six different BAFs. The wedge is held at the
fixed distance of 50 cm from the observer’s eye using a taut string, as
this produces a sighting ratio of 1:50. At this ratio, a 1 cm aperture
corresponds to a BAF of 1 or a basal area of 1 m<sup>2</sup>/ha. To
determine the aperture for the specific BAFs of the basal wedge, the
following equation was used:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">A = &#8730;(BAF * D&#178;) &#247; 0.25)</span> (2)</p>
<p>Where A is the aperture in centimetres and D is the fixed distance
that the wedge is held from the eye in metres (i.e. 0.5 m; Muir <em>et
al.</em> 2011)</p>

    tern:purpose """<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
    <p>All biological processes of plants and animals are dependent on the
energy of primary production (i.e. the energy fixed and incorporated
into biomass by plants), making it a fundamental component of an
ecosystem. Measurements of biomass are important in ecosystem
surveillance monitoring to help understand structural, functional and
compositional ecosystem dynamics. For example, vegetation composition
characterised by biomass is a prime indicator of species dominance
within a vegetation association (Bonham 2013), and change in biomass
over time is an important indicator of forest and woodland recovery
during succession (Gilman <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>
<p>Direct and accurate measurements of biomass can be obtained by
felling, dissecting and weighing trees (West 2015). However, this method
is destructive and unsuitable for ecological monitoring, which requires
repeated measurements and in which the premise is to avoid environmental
damage. Biomass is often therefore estimated from its allometric
relationship with basal area, as both are related to stem diameter
(Eamus <em>et al.</em> 2000; Sarmiento <em>et al.</em> 2005).
Measurements of basal area can be easily obtained on ground and are good
indicators for biomass as they integrate the effect of both the number
and size of trees (Burrows <em>et al.</em> 2000).</p>
<p>Diameter at breast height (DBH) measured using a diameter tape or
tree caliper is the standard for recording trunk or stem diameter (West
2015) and has thus been adopted for the Enhanced and Standard DBH
protocols. Trees with a DBH ≥10 cm are measured as this is a global
forest ecology standard for defining a tree (DECCW 2010; Wood <em>et
al.</em> 2015). However, In sites dominated by mallee and mulga, all
stems with a DBH ≥5 cm are measured (TERN 2015). The POM above ground
level is recorded for every measurement as it may not be possible to
measure DBH at 1.3 m in every circumstance (i.e. for problem trees). For
mallee that often branch into multiple stems below 1.3 m and mulga that
often branch close to the ground and then taper rapidly, it is
recommended that diameter measurements are taken at 30 cm from the
ground or if branching lower than 10 cm from the ground and the POM
recorded as such (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2005; Paul <em>et al.</em>
2016). This ensures that the same position is measured on each occasion
during repeat monitoring (West 2015).</p>
<p>The Basal wedge protocol uses point sampling to measure basal area in
m<sup>2</sup>/ha. This method has several advantages including its low
cost, simplicity and rapidness, as individual tree measurements are not
required (White <em>et al.</em> 2012; Balderas Torres and Lovett 2013).
Since individual tree data are not collected, downstream analysis is
limited to basal area data only. An explanation of point sampling is
provided for reference in <a href="#appendices-1">Appendix 1.</a></p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
    tern:scope """
    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction and background</h1>
<p>Basal area is the average amount of area occupied by tree stems
within a defined locale. It is quantified by measuring the
cross-sectional area of all trees, over the bark, at breast height (1.3
m above ground level) and values are expressed per hectare
(m<sup>2</sup>/ha). Basal area provides information on stand density, is
useful for monitoring tree growth, and can be used to calculating tree
biomass and carbon sequestration using allometric equations (Eamus
<em>et al.</em> 2000). The Basal Area Module is only required in plots
where there is a dominant growth form of trees, shrubs and/or mallee
greater than 2 m in height, but can also be undertaken as part of
condition assessments.</p>
<p>Basal area can be measured using ‘plot sampling’ (i.e. the
measurement of the basal area of all trees in a set area) or ‘point
sampling’ (i.e. the estimation of basal area from a count of ‘in’ trees
throughout a 360° sweep at a sampling point). For plot sampling, the
basal area of a tree is calculated from its diameter at breast height
(DBH), being the diameter of the trunk in metres as measured 1.3 m above
the ground. DBH is converted to basal area based on the formula for the
area of a circle:</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>B</em><em>a</em><em>s</em><em>a</em><em>l</em> <em>a</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>a</em> = <em>π</em>  × (<em>D</em><em>B</em><em>H</em> ÷ 2)<sup>2</sup></span>
(1)</p>
<p>Basal area per hectare is calculated by adding the basal areas (as
calculated above) of all the trees in a defined locale and dividing by
the area of land in which the trees were measured. Basal area is
generally measured for a plot and then scaled to m<sup>2</sup>/ha to
compare forest/woodland productivity and growth rate among multiple
sites.</p>
<p>Basal area can be rapidly estimated at a sampling point using a
hand-held angle gauge. A mathematical correlation exists between the
distance from the observer’s eye and the aperture of the device. This is
referred to as the basal area factor (BAF). Basal area can be estimated
in m<sup>2</sup>/ha by multiplying the count of ‘in’ trees across a 360°
sweep with the selected BAF. When using an angle gauge, a tree is ‘in’
if its trunk or stem at breast height is wider than the aperture of the
selected BAF. Trees where the trunk or stem is the exact width of the
aperture, are ‘borderline’ trees, for which a half count is tallied.</p>
<p>The Basal Area Module includes three protocols: (1) Enhanced DBH
protocol that measures the DBH of all trees with a DBH ≥10 cm (or DBH ≥5
cm for mulga and mallee systems) within the core plot (100 x 100 m;
Figure 1); (2) Standard DBH protocol that measures the DBH of all trees
with a DBH ≥10 cm (or DBH ≥5 cm for mulga and mallee systems) in a 40 x
40 m sub-plot situated in the centre of the core plot (Figure 1); and
(3) Basal wedge protocol where a 360° sweep is made at nine sampling
points across the core plot (Figure 1) using a TERN basal wedge (Figure
2).</p>
<p>The Enhanced DBH protocol, although time-consuming, particularly in
dense stands, is best practice and recommended for projects where
accurate and repeatable measures of basal area are critical (e.g.
forestry and forest ecology projects). The Standard DBH protocol offers
a pragmatic approach to obtain accurate and repeatable measures of basal
area based on DBH measures within a sub-sample of the plot. The Standard
DBH protocol is recommended for time-limited projects where DBH measures
are required and can be undertaken concurrently as part of other modules
(e.g. Recruitment Module and Condition Module)<em>.</em></p>
<p>The Basal wedge protocol provides a simple and rapid method to
estimate basal area across the plot. This approach extends the area
sampled beyond the plot to provide a reliable estimate of basal area on
a m2/ha basis for each species and the total basal area of the sampled
vegetation association. The Basal wedge protocol is recommended for
projects that require rapid but reliable measures of basal area. The
TERN basal wedge comprises six Basal Area Factors (BAFs), ranging from
0.1 to 2 (Figure 2) that are suitable for use across Australia.</p>
