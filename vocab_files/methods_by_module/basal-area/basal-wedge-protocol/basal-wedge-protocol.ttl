the number and experience of personnel. As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 30 minutes to complete the basal wedge survey per
plot.</p></li>

<li><p>Do not record the data if less than seven ‘in’ trees for a given

are less than seven ‘in’ trees with the smallest BAF (0.1), no data is
recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the trunk or stem is exactly the width of the BAF (i.e.
‘borderline’ tree), add a half count to your tally (<a href="#figure-6">Figure 6</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the widest suitable BAF to sample seven ‘in’ trees for the
species. This increases efficiency as it reduces the number of ‘in’
trees likely. For example, use the ‘1’ BAF to record eight ‘in’ trees
rather than the ‘0.5’ BAF to record 15 ‘in’ trees.</p></li>
<li><p>It is more efficient to use the same BAF for every species at

example, the ‘0.5’ BAF may be suitable to be used for <em>species x</em>
at all sampling locations; while the ‘0.1’ BAF may be required for
<em>species y</em> at all sampling locations, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>For each species, only use one BAF at each sampling location. Do
not make separate counts of ‘in’ trees using different BAFs for the same
species.</p></li>

<li><p>Buttressed trees should be measured above the buttress.</p></li>
<li><p>For multi-stemmed trees, measure each stem individually and add

<p><span class="anchor" id="_Ref138703508"></span><h3>Appendix 1. Basal
wedge – point sampling explanation</h3></p>
<p>In point sampling, basal area is estimated based on the concept of
circles (trunks or stems) within circles (variable circular plots). The area of one circle varies proportionally to a change in
the area of the other circle (i.e. the area sampled is greater for
larger than smaller trees) and trees are sampled with a probability
proportional to their basal area. Therefore, large trees, which
contribute more to the basal area of a stand, are sampled in greater
proportions than small trees (Hovind and Rieck 1970).</p>
<p>An observer rotates 360° at a sampling point and counts all the
trunks or stems that form an angle greater than the chosen BAF. In
effect, every tree counted is sampled in a variable circular plot with a
radius that is a function of the tree’s DBH (<a href="#figure-7a">Figure 7a</a>). Because a
tree’s DBH determines its basal area, and the plot radius determines the
sampling area for that tree, the contribution of each counted tree to
total stand basal area can be determined. For such a sample of trees,
there is a constant relationship between tree DBH and effective sampling
area, and therefore each tree counted represents the same contribution
to the basal area of the stand. To estimate the total stand basal area,
the only calculation required is to multiply the count of ‘in’ trees by
the BAF used, which is determined from the aperture width used with an
angle gauge and the fixed distance that the angle gauge is held from the
eye (Fastie 2010). Measurements of variable circular plot radii and DBHs
are not required as these values are proportional to the aperture width
used with an angle gauge and the fixed distance that the angle gauge is
held from the eye (<a href="#figure-7b">Figure 7b</a>).</p>

<figcaption><p>Figure. 7a. 360° point sampling sweep showing an ‘in’
(counted), ‘out’ (not counted) and ‘borderline’ tree (half counted). The
dashed circles represent the variable circular plot for each tree that
is proportional to its diameter at breast height (not to
scale).</p></figcaption>

<p>Figure. 7b. Principle of point sampling. The diameter at breast height
(DBH) and variable circular plot radius (R) of a ‘borderline’ tree are
proportional to the aperture (a) width of an angle gauge and the fixed
distance (d) that the angle gauge is held from the eye.</figure></p>
<p>The Basal wedge protocol measures basal area at nine sampling points
(Figure 1) using a TERN Basal Wedge (Figure 2). The TERN Basal Wedge is
an angle gauge designed by TERN Ecosystem Surveillance for monitoring
basal areas across Australia. The hexagonal basal wedge has six fixed
angle gauges that represent six different BAFs. The wedge is held at the
fixed distance of 50 cm from the observer’s eye using a taut string, as
this produces a sighting ratio of 1:50. At this ratio, a 1 cm aperture
corresponds to a BAF of 1 or a basal area of 1 m<sup>2</sup>/ha. To
determine the aperture for the specific BAFs of the basal wedge, the
following equation was used:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">A = &#8730;(BAF * D&#178;) &#247; 0.25)</span> (2)</p>
<p>Where A is the aperture in centimetres and D is the fixed distance
that the wedge is held from the eye in metres (i.e. 0.5 m; Muir <em>et
al.</em> 2011)</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ensure the Plot Selection and Layout Module has been completed to
mark out the plot (including the centre point and north, south, east and
west point sampling locations) and define the current plot and visit in
the Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the Monitor app and navigate to the Basal Area Module and
then the Basal wedge protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Stand at one of the nine basal wedge sampling locations (see
    <a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>) and select the location from the drop-down list (<a href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2</a>).
It does not matter which order the sampling locations are
surveyed.</p></li>
<li><p>Hold the end knot of the 50 cm length of string attached to the
wedge on your cheek below one eye – close the other eye. Hold the wedge
so that the string is taut (see <a href="#figure-5">Figure 5</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if the use of the basal wedge is warranted at the plot
(i.e. are there sufficient trunks or stems of trees, tall shrubs or
mallee that are large enough to obtain a score of seven or more from
‘in’ and ‘borderline’ trees for any species). If there are not
sufficient trees to sample then the Enhanced or Standard DBH protocols
are recommended to complete basal area measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>For each species, establish which Basal Area Factor (BAF; 0.1,
0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2) to use. This is determined by selecting a BAF
and undertaking a brief sweep around the point sampling location to
determine if the selected BAF will sample seven or more ‘in’ trees (see
<a href="#rules-to-determine-in-trees">Additional guidelines</a> below
for rules on counting ‘in’ and ‘borderline’ trees) for the sampling
location. Ideally, aim to achieve the minimum seven ‘in’ trees with the
largest aperture width.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have selected the appropriate BAF for a species, rotate
through a complete 360° sweep and, looking through the eye above the
string, count the number of stems or trunks of each species at breast
height, that are wider than the aperture of the chosen BAF as ‘in’, and
the exact width of the aperture as ‘borderline’ (i.e. half
count).</p></li>
<li><p>Record the <em>floristics voucher</em> (i.e. the field name
recorded for the species in the Floristics Module). Species that cannot
be easily distinguished from one another may be combined for the basal
wedge count. In this case, check the <em>group species</em> box and
select all relevant floristics vouchers. This is only applicable if they
are of the same genus and growth form (e.g. mallee).</p></li>
<li><p>Record the BAF used (from the drop-down list; see <a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>),
and the tally of ‘in’ and ‘borderline’ trees for that particular
species.</p></li>
<li><p>Date and time will be automatically recorded. Update if required
and then save the observation.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 6–10 for the remaining species at the sampling
location using the blue <em>+</em> button.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>finish sampling location</em> button to return to
the sampling location selection screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 3–12 at each remaining sampling location.</p></li>
<li><p>When basal area has been recorded for each species at each
sampling location, queue the collection for submission.</p></li>
