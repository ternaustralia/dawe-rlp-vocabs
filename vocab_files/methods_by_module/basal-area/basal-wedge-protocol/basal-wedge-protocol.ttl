<ul>
<li><p>The plot must be established using the Plot Layout and Selection
Module prior to conducting the DBH protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>The Plot Description Module must be completed prior to, or during
the reconnaissance survey using the active search protocol.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-requirements-1">Time requirements</h3>
<p>Survey activity time will vary depending on the options chosen and
the density of vegetation to traverse. A tree survey is highly dependent
on the number of trees to be measured. As a general guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow 1-2 hours for survey planning</p></li>
<li><p>Allow 20 - 40 minutes for plot set-up and laying tape measures
(assuming the plot has been previously set-up using the Plot Selection
and Layout Module).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow thirty minutes to complete the basal wedge survey per
plot.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personnel-requirements-1">Personnel requirements</h3>
<p>Number of personnel and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Basal wedge sweeps may be conducted by a single observer and the
observations can be recorded directly into the Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p>The surveyor making observations should be familiar with and
experienced in identifying traits specific to tree species and how to
distinguish different species from one another.</p></li>
<li><p>Basal wedge sweeps do not involve interference with wildlife.
Therefore, scientific permits and wildlife ethics approvals are unlikely
to be required but remember to always check with the local authority.
Access permissions are required.</p></li>

<li><p>Species that cannot be easily distinguished from one another may

equation will be the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not record the data if less than seven ‘in’ trees for a given
BAF are achieved for each species. Data become meaningless with less
than seven ‘in’ trees. Repeat the sweep using a smaller BAF, or if there
are less than seven ‘in’ trees with the smallest BAF (0.1), no data is
recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the trunk or stem is exactly the width of the BAF (i.e.
‘borderline’ tree), add a half count to your tally (<a href="#figure-6">Figure 6</a>.).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the widest suitable BAF to sample seven ‘in’ trees for the
species. This increases efficiency as it reduces the number of ‘in’
trees likely. For example, use the ‘1’ BAF to record eight ‘in’ trees
rather than the ‘0.5’ BAF to record 15 ‘in’ trees.</p></li>
<li><p>It is more efficient to use the same BAF for every species at
each sampling location. However, this is not always practicable. For
example, the ‘0.5’ BAF may be suitable to be used for <em>species x</em>
at all sampling locations; while the ‘0.1’ BAF may be required for
<em>species y</em> at all sampling locations, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>For each species, only use one BAF at each sampling location. Do
not make separate counts of ‘in’ trees using different BAFs for the same
species.</p></li>

<li><p>Buttressed trees should be measured above the buttress.</p></li>
<li><p>For multi-stemmed trees, measure each stem individually and add
all ‘in’ stems to your tally.</p></li>
<li><p>For trees on a slope, the 1.3 m POM should be measured on the

<li><p>For leaning trees, hold the basal wedge at a tilt so that the

<h2 id="post-field-survey-tasks-1">Post-field survey tasks</h2>
<h3 id="sample-curation-1">Sample curation</h3>
<p>The Basal wedge protocol does not collect samples. There are no

<h2 id="data-submission">Data submission</h2>
<p>Data from the Basal Area Module is collected in the field using the
Monitor app. Data entry is completed in the app, photos are taken using
the app (or later linked if taken on other devices), and voucher
barcodes are scanned in the app to link voucher numbers to the unique
data. All data is checked for correctness and completeness in the app
before it is submitted.</p>
<p>Once all data is finalised, and marked as completed, the data is
submitted from the Monitor app to the staging server by an explicit user
action. If the device is offline at the time, the data will be pushed as
soon as it is reconnected to a network (i.e. either back in mobile phone
range or a wi-fi network). Once data reaches the staging server it is
prepared in an export interface for delivery to the Biodiversity Data
Repository. DCCEEW is then responsible for managing the data. In the
future, it is anticipated that data curation tools will be made
available to project personnel.</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;

<p><span class="anchor" id="_Ref138703508"></span><h3>Appendix 1. Basal wedge
– point sampling explanation</h3></p>
<p>In point sampling, basal area is estimated based on the concept of
circles (trunks or stems) within circles (variable circular plots; see
Figure. a.). The area of one circle varies proportionally to a change in
the area of the other circle (i.e. the area sampled is greater for
larger than smaller trees) and trees are sampled with a probability
proportional to their basal area. Therefore, large trees, which
contribute more to the basal area of a stand, are sampled in greater
proportions than small trees (Hovind and Rieck 1970).</p>
<p>An observer rotates 360° at a sampling point and counts all the
trunks or stems that form an angle greater than the chosen BAF. In
effect, every tree counted is sampled in a variable circular plot with a
radius that is a function of the tree’s DBH (Figure. a). Because a
tree’s DBH determines its basal area, and the plot radius determines the
sampling area for that tree, the contribution of each counted tree to
total stand basal area can be determined. For such a sample of trees,
there is a constant relationship between tree DBH and effective sampling
area, and therefore each tree counted represents the same contribution
to the basal area of the stand. To estimate the total stand basal area,
the only calculation required is to multiply the count of ‘in’ trees by
the BAF used, which is determined from the aperture width used with an
angle gauge and the fixed distance that the angle gauge is held from the
eye (Fastie 2010). Measurements of variable circular plot radii and DBHs
are not required as these values are proportional to the aperture width
used with an angle gauge and the fixed distance that the angle gauge is
held from the eye (Figure. b.).</p>

<p>Figure. b. Principle of point sampling. The diameter at breast height
(DBH) and variable circular plot radius (R) of a ‘borderline’ tree are
proportional to the aperture (a) width of an angle gauge and the fixed
distance (d) that the angle gauge is held from the eye.</p>
<p>The Basal wedge protocol measures basal area at nine sampling points
(<a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>.) using a TERN Basal Wedge (<a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>). The TERN Basal Wedge
is an angle gauge designed by TERN Ecosystem Surveillance for monitoring
basal areas across Australia. The hexagonal basal wedge has six fixed
angle gauges that represent six different BAFs. The wedge is held at the
fixed distance of 50 cm from the observer’s eye using a taut string, as
this produces a sighting ratio of 1:50. At this ratio, a 1 cm aperture
corresponds to a BAF of 1 or a basal area of 1 m<sup>2</sup>/ha. To
determine the aperture for the specific BAFs of the basal wedge, the
following equation was used:</p>
<p>𝐴=<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-size:larger">
    &radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">(𝐵𝐴𝐹 &times;𝐷^2&nbsp;&divide;0.25)&nbsp;</span>
    </span></p>
<p>Where A is the aperture in centimetres and D is the fixed distance
that the wedge is held from the eye in metres (i.e. 0.5 m; Muir <em>et
al.</em> 2011)</p>

<li><p>Hold the end knot of the 50 cm length of string attached to the
wedge on your cheek below one eye – close the other eye. Hold the wedge
so that the string is taut (see <a href="#figure-5">Figure 5</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if the use of the basal wedge is warranted at the plot
(i.e. are there sufficient trunks or stems of trees, tall shrubs or
mallee that are large enough to count seven or more ‘in’ trees for any
species) If there are not sufficient trees to sample then the Enhanced
or Standard DBH protocols are recommended to complete basal area
measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>For each species, establish which Basal Area Factor (BAF) (0.1,
0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2) to use. This is determined by selecting a BAF
and undertaking a brief sweep around the point sampling location to
determine if the selected BAF will sample seven or more ‘in’ trees (see
<a href="#additional-guidelines-1">Additional guidelines</a> below
for rules on counting ‘in’ and ‘borderline’ trees) for the sampling
location. Ideally, aim to achieve the minimum seven ‘in’ trees with the
largest aperture width.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have selected the appropriate BAF for a species, rotate
through a complete 360° sweep and, looking through the eye above the
string, count the number of stems or trunks of each species at breast
height, that are wider than the aperture of the chosen BAF as ‘in’, and
the exact width of the aperture as ‘borderline’ (i.e. half
count).</p></li>
<li><p>Record the species, and the BAF used (from the drop-down list
