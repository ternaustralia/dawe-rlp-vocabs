<p>
  Ensure the 40 x 40 m sub-plot area is defined by the condition point-intercept
  transects (Figure 6). It is recommended that the sub-plot survey is undertaken
  directly after the condition point- intercept to make use of the tapes that
  have already been laid.

<p><strong>DBH size class survey</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Traverse the sub-plot systematically and record the number of trees and
    shrubs that fall within each of the seven DBH size classes (DBH is measured
    at 1.3 m, only record individuals that are at least 1.3 m tall). If
    required, mark or flag individuals that have been counted, or use additional
    tapes to sub-divide the plot to assist with the survey.

  <li>
    Total numbers for each size class and plant type (tree or shrub) can be
    increased (using the tally counter) as you systematically move across the

<ol>
  <li>
    Refer to the DBH size threshold table in the supporting information
    (Appendix 12) and determine the DBH threshold for large trees for the system
    under study. Enter the threshold into the app for reference. This
    information will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.
  </li>
  <li>
    Traverse the sub-plot systematically and measure DBH (at 1.3 m) to determine
    the number of large trees present in the area. Record number of large trees
    (≥ DBH threshold) on a per species basis (or to genus level if an individual
    cannot be identified to species level).
  </li>
  <li>
    Total numbers for each species can be increased (using the tally counter) as
    you systematically move across the sub-plot by pressing the button.

    Select Save and Continue once the entire subplot has been surveyed for large
