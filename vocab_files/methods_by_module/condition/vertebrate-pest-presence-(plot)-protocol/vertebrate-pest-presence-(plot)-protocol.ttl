  <li>
    Mobile device (tablet/phone capable of taking high resolution photos) with
    the App (progressive web app) saved to the home screen

  <li>4 x 100 m tape measures or pegs to mark plot boundary</li>
  <li>Binoculars (optional)</li>
</ul>""" ;
    ns1:instructions """<ol>
  <li>
    Ensure the Plot selection and layout module has been completed to mark out
    the plot boundary with a very high accuracy using the Trimble R1.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure the plot corners and/or plot boundary are marked with tape measures
    or survey flags and each boundary can be easily identified.
  </li>
  <li>
    Traverse the plot and record any evidence of vertebrate pest fauna. Only
    presence is recorded, there is no requirement to record abundance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Record any pest vertebrate fauna evidence by selecting the type from the
    drop-down list. Multiple can be selected for each vertebrate pest.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a pest species is observed, but not listed, select 'Other' and enter the
    pest’s name. Multiple 'Other' species can be entered, and each will be added
    to the list as a separate vertebrate pest entry.
  </li>
  <li>
    Record any other comments about the pest species present in the Comments
    field (optional).
  </li>
  <li>
    Take photos to document any pest fauna signs (optional). Each photo taken
    should be labelled with a short description.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the entire plot has been surveyed, click Save and Continue.
