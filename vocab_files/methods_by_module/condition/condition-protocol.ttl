<h2 id="available-protocols">Available protocols</h2>
<p>Each of the field measures in the Condition Module describe
biodiversity condition. The module provides procedures and guidelines
for recording a set of core attributes, in combination with measures
from the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/4f0f0ca4-d8f7-472d-9203-f46a565ad970">Recruitment</a>, <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/0d8b47b4-1ca8-4c76-8329-0eb781a823a2">Coarse Woody Debris</a>, <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/91a54c7c-48ff-402d-a761-ed4fd4ad4a4b">Fire Severity</a> and the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/dd2da1e0-edbe-4f20-a1ae-b860876c1837">Herbivory and
Physical Damage</a> Modules, which collectively form the condition set of
protocols. The results from other modules, including <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics</a>, <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover</a>
and <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/8e7c86ce-e283-4cea-aca7-44ed7a22629c">Signs-based Fauna</a> Surveys also feed into condition assessments. This
protocol includes step-by-step instructions for the core set of
condition measures. Refer to the Recruitment, Coarse Woody Debris, Fire
and Herbivory and Physical Damage Modules for survey guidelines for
these measures (links to the relevant sections are provided below).</p>
<h2 id="relationships-to-other-modules">Relationships to other
modules</h2>
<h3 id="mandatory-related-modules">Mandatory related modules</h3>
<p>Complete prior to the Condition Module</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/d15d05db-5007-411e-b257-105ef4f76821">Plot Selection and Layout Module</a> – needs to be undertaken before
any condition surveys can take place.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> – a physical description of the plot is
required to place condition data in context with the surrounding
landform, land surface, vegetation and disturbance regime.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics Module</a> – needs to be completed before the Recruitment
Module which is a requirement of the condition assessment. Information
can only be entered against species (or field names) recorded during the
Floristics Module. The results from the Floristics Module provide
information on the diversity of native and weed plant species, which are
important condition measures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Complete concurrently with the Condition Module</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/4f0f0ca4-d8f7-472d-9203-f46a565ad970">Recruitment Module</a> - the Age structure protocol from the
Recruitment Module must be undertaken as part of the condition
assessment. Seedling, sapling and juvenile counts, combined with the
tree survey enable a summary of all growth and life stages to be
generated and facilitates an assessment of age class structure.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/0d8b47b4-1ca8-4c76-8329-0eb781a823a2">Coarse Woody Debris Module</a> - must be completed as part of the
condition assessment to record coarse woody debris length, diameter and
decay class. CWD abundance contributes to a range of ecosystem processes
that impact the condition of an ecosystem and is therefore considered a
condition attribute.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/f7e0d965-ae73-434e-8599-634598e506b5">Basal Area Module</a> – the DBH protocol from the Basal Area Module
must be completed concurrently with the Tree survey sub-protocol. DBH
combined with height measurements contribute to the age and size class
determinations as well as determine the biomass within a project
area.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optional-complementary-related-modules">Optional complementary
related modules</h3>
<p>Optional complementary modules to gather additional information
relating to condition:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover Module</a> – the Condition Module uses a subset of the
point-intercept transects established during the Cover Module, referred
to as the sub-plot. It is recommended that condition assessments are
completed after the Cover Module to make use of the tapes that have
already been set up. The results of the Cover Module feed into the
overall condition assessments and analysis and provide information about
native and weed cover.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/91a54c7c-48ff-402d-a761-ed4fd4ad4a4b">Fire Severity Module</a> - recommended that this be completed as part
of the condition assessment if the plot has been recently burnt (shows
signs of recovery from fire estimated to be from the last 5-10 years).
Fire severity data can be used to inform on the condition of the project
area.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/dd2da1e0-edbe-4f20-a1ae-b860876c1837">Herbivory and
Physical Damage Module</a> – one of two protocols,
either the Belt transect protocol or Sub-plot protocol, is recommended
to record any herbivory or physical damage present in the project area.
The impact of herbivory and physical damage by fauna impacts the
condition of a system.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/8b334ccd-5e1a-474c-88e1-0f9b02d7d9c6">Interventions Module</a> – it is recommended that condition
assessments are undertaken before and after any interventions occur. The
Condition attributes protocol is focused predominantly on assessing
changes in condition following on-ground interventions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/8e7c86ce-e283-4cea-aca7-44ed7a22629c">Signs-based Fauna Surveys</a> – if there are obvious signs of fauna
presence completion of at least one of the plot-based protocols within
the module is recommended to collect indicators of pest fauna presence
and/or impact. Choose from either the Within-plot belt transects
protocol, or the Active plot search protocol (best suited for sandy
environments).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/05669173-2fe7-4b70-ba67-2e09fbe87de9">Photopoints Module</a> - panoramic photos taken from the centre of
the plot in the Photopoints Module provide a visual representation of
the plot and the features described in the Plot Description Module and
could be used as reference for the condition of a plot over
time.</p></li>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="general">General </h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Partitioning the sub-plot into more manageable units using
existing Cover point-intercept transect tapes, additional tapes and/or
coloured survey pins is highly recommended, particularly in dense
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot boundaries should be marked out according to the existing
method described in the Plot Selection and Layout Module.</p></li>
<li><p>Assessment across the plot is used to document signs of pest
fauna, record fire scar height, and document age class structure, growth
and life-stages, and health of the perennial species present.</p></li>
<li><p>Assessment of fire extent and severity is undertaken in the Fire
Module (which is carried out within the Cover Module). If a condition
survey is to be undertaken, ensure that the fire option has been
activated in the Cover Module.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="tree-survey-1">Tree survey </h4>
<ul>
<li><p>A tree is considered in the plot if than 50% of the base of the
trunk is within the plot (<a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Tree height can be estimated using a forestry rangefinder for
rapid and accurate height measurements. The person entering the data
into the Monitor app can carry the rangefinder on a lanyard over their
shoulder and record tree height when required.</p></li>
<li><p>Where a rangefinder is not available, tree height can be
estimated using the following methods:</p></li>

2007)</p></li>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="tree-health">Tree health</h4>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="canopy-cover">Canopy cover</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Canopy cover is assessed as the percentage of foliage missing
from the canopy relative to a reference tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Reference trees can be an archetype of a species with optimal
foliage (absolute reference tree), or a nearby tree with maximum foliage
considering site conditions, altitude, latitude, etc., (local reference)
(Dobbertin 2005; Eichhorn and Roskams 2013).</p></li>
<li><p>Local reference trees are generally best, and a suitable tree is
one that is presumed to be completely healthy (i.e. stress-free), of the
same species, similar age and with maximum foliage (Dobbertin 2005;
Thimonier <em>et al.</em> 2010; Eichhorn <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p></li>
<li><p>Canopy cover is scored in 5% increments, and a healthy tree would
have a canopy cover score of 100% (i.e. 0% defoliation or dieback),
whereas a tree with 25% dieback would have a canopy score of
75%.</p></li>
<li><p>To estimate percentage canopy, visualise a circle around the
outer boundary of the crown. Estimate the proportion of dead crown and
the remainder is the proportion of healthy crown cover (Michaels
2006).</p></li>
<li><p>Epicormic shoots below the crown, absent or fallen branches, and
lower limbs that do not form part of the canopy are not included in
assessable canopy (Michaels 2006; Eichhorn <em>et al.</em>
2020).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="crown-damage-index">Crown Damage Index</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>The incidence and severity of each type of foliage damage
(necrosis, discolouration and defoliation) is also assessed for each
tree (Stone <em>et al.</em> 2003). Incidence (<em>I</em>) is the
percentage of leaves in the canopy affected, and severity (<em>S</em>)
is the percentage of each individual leaf affected. Info buttons will be
provided in the app for easy reference.</p></li>
<li><p>Incidence and severity scores for each type of damage are then
multiplied together and divided by 100 i.e., (<em>I</em> x
<em>S)</em>/100.</p></li>
<li><p>The results for each are then added to produce an overall Crown
Damage Index (CDI).</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, the crown can be divided and the incidence and
severity across all types of damage can be estimated for each portion
and then summed to produce an overall CDI.</p></li>
<li><p>The Crown Damage Index (CDI) is created by visually assessing the
incidence (extent of damage over the entire canopy), and severity
(percentage of each leaf affected), of missing, damaged and discoloured
foliage (Stone <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p></li>
<li><p>There are three types of damage:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Defoliation – where entire leaves or parts of leaves are missing
(Figure A5.1)</p></li>
<li><p>Necrosis – presence of dead leaf tissue (Figure A5.2)</p></li>
<li><p>Discolouration – non-green leaf tissue including yellowing or
reddish-purple discolouration, chlorotic spots or margins (Figure A5.2).
Natural variation of leaf colour needs to be considered when assessing
discolouration, for example <em>Eucalyptus</em> leaves can change colour
as they develop.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="general-guidelines-for-canopy-health">General
guidelines for canopy health</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Although assessments of canopy cover and foliage damage are
subjective, observer bias can be reduced by having the same observer
team for each survey, creating a photo library of local reference trees
with typical canopy morphology, and intercalibrating between observers
and across surveys (Eichhorn and Roskams 2013).</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to observe each tree from several positions,
ideally standing at a distance equal to the height of the tree. An
elevated position ensures a better view.</p></li>
<li><p>Where possible take a closer look at branches, leaves and stems
for signs as to what may be causing the stress symptoms (e.g. galls and
lerps, boreholes etc., are indicative of insect infestation. <a href="#appendix-6">Appendix 6</a>
provides examples of the types of damage produced by insect and
disease). Binoculars are helpful for looking higher into the canopy. Use
the comments field to add notes regarding potential causes of
damage.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="mistletoe">Mistletoe </h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Walk around the tree to ensure that all mistletoes are identified
and counted correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>Only record living mistletoe.</p></li>
<li><p>Mistletoe abundance generally increases with tree height,
diameter and basal area.</p></li>
<li><p>Trees close to a patch edge or another infested individual are
more likely to host mistletoe (Ward 2005).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="hollows">Hollows</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Walk around the tree to ensure that all hollows are identified
and counted correctly.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="leaf-litter">Leaf litter </h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Leaf litter is all the plant organic matter above the top layer
of the compacted soil, mostly consisting of decaying and dry leaves
(Moses <em>et al.</em> 2021), but can also include needles, grass, twigs
and bark (Wundke <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p></li>
<li><p>Leaf litter does not include coarse woody debris or woody
debris.</p></li>
<li><p>Push the ruler through the litter until it reaches the soil
surface. The soil surface should be firm.</p></li>
<li><p>Measures of litter depth can have low accuracy (Marimon-Junior
and Hay 2008), so ensure that the light pressure applied until there is
even contact with the litter surface is consistent across sampling
locations.</p></li>
<li><p>If leaf litter measurement device is not available, an equivalent
can be created with a standard 30 cm ruler and a piece of cardboard.
Ensure that the tool used is consistent throughout the survey.</p></li>
<li><p>The same individual should conduct all leaf litter measurements
to reduce error.</p></li>

crown damage and calculating the Crown Damage Index (CDI).</h4></p>
<p>The Crown Damage Index (CDI) is created by visually assessing the
incidence (extent of damage over the entire canopy), and severity
(percentage of each leaf affected), of missing, damaged and discoloured
foliage (Stone <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p>
<p>There are three types of damage:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Defoliation – where entire leaves or parts of leaves are missing
(Figure A5.1)</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Necrosis – presence of dead leaf tissue (<a href="#figure-a2">Figure A2</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Discolouration – non-green leaf tissue including yellowing or
reddish-purple discolouration, chlorotic spots or margins (<a href="#figure-a2">Figure A2</a>).
Natural variation of leaf colour needs to be considered when assessing
discolouration, for example eucalyptus leaves can change colour as they
develop.</p></li>
</ol>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="calculating-cdi">Calculating CDI</h5>
<p>CDI is calculated by multiplying, for each type of damage or each
portion of the crown, the incidence (<em>I</em>) by the severity
(<em>S</em>), and then dividing the product by 100. If there are several
types of damage present, or sections of crown affected, these values are
then summed to produce and overall value.</p>
<p>For example, if calculating CDI based on each type of damage present,
imagine a tree where:</p>
<p>50% of leaves are affected by defoliation (<em>S</em> = 50%) with on
average about 30% of individual leaves missing (<em>I</em> = 30%)</p>
<p>+ 20% necrotic damage per leaf (<em>S</em> = 20%) to the lower 15% of
the canopy (<em>I</em> = 15%)</p>
<p>+ 10% of leaves (<em>I</em> = 10%) are discoloured with around 15% of
each leaf affected (<em>S</em> = 15%)</p>
<p>= (50 x 30)/100 + (20 x 15)/100 + (15 x 10)/100 = 15 + 3 + 1.5</p>
<p>CDI = 19.5</p>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Adequate monitoring of condition remains a prerequisite for
environmental decision-making and for tracking progress towards
management goals (Lawley <em>et al.</em> 2016). However, condition data
is patchy and despite a number of approaches being developed there is
still no consistent way to assess condition across the country (NERP
National Condition Working Group 2015). As a result, there is a need for
cost-effective condition assessments that provide robust and rigorous
data (Cook <em>et al.</em> 2010). An understanding of condition is
needed to inform regional priorities, establish policies, design and
evaluate natural resource management (NRM) programs and measure change
(Thackway <em>et al.</em> 2015). At the project scale, monitoring
condition allows the response of ecological attributes such as ground
cover and native plant diversity to be determined in relation to
management interventions or developments. At a broader scale, data from
a range of projects can provide information on the overall performance
of NRM programs, across interventions, vegetation types and regions (DOE
2013; Eco Logical Australia 2013), and for development projects can help
determine if environmental impacts, including impacts on matters of
national environmental significance are being managed appropriately
(Commonwealth of Australia 2020).</p>
<p>Currently, condition tends to be measured by visual and/or systematic
assessments (Neldner 2006; Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009; Cook <em>et
al.</em> 2010; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015), but visual estimates can be
highly variable compared to systematic assessments, especially at small
scales. Observers often simplify their assessments by responding to only
some of the condition parameters, and as a result, more systematic
assessments are needed when management decisions require an
understanding of changes in individual condition attributes (Cook <em>et
al.</em> 2010). In addition, a greater range of analysis options are
available when the data is collected as continuous rather than
categorical data. This information allows changes in individual
attributes to be monitored, aggregated and analysed to explore a range
of issues related to condition (ESCAVI 2007; Williams 2010).</p>
<p>The approach outlined in this module has been developed to align with
existing condition assessment methods where possible but improves the
way condition is measured across the country by focusing on the
collection of quantitative data. A summary of each attribute, reason for
collection and survey methods are detailed below.</p>
<p><strong>Age and size class (Condition Module):</strong> The size (DBH
and height), growth stage and life-stage are recorded for all trees,
tall shrubs or mallee &gt;2 m tall and with a DBH ≥10 cm present within
the central 40 x 40 m sub-plot. This enables age class structure to be
determined and to assist with the interpretation of changes that occur
over time, particularly following natural disturbance or interventions
(DEC 2012). Trees can be categorised post-survey based on DBH measures
into designated size classes relevant to the study system (see <a href="#appendices">Appendix</a>).
A mix of stem sizes indicates multiple successful recruitment events
have occurred and the presence of very large individuals indicates that
the system retains old-growth characteristics such as tree-hollows and
roosting sites which can be important for a range of fauna species
(Oliver <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p>
<p><strong>Life-stage (<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/4f0f0ca4-d8f7-472d-9203-f46a565ad970">Recruitment</a> and <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/16a20c3f-e95d-4919-b2d1-a25c7a275109">Condition</a> Modules):</strong>
Life-stage is recorded for all perennial species present within the 1 ha
plot as part of the Recruitment Module. Life-stage is also recorded in
the central 40 x 40 m sub-plot as part of the Condition tree survey
protocol and in the seedling, sapling and juvenile counts in the
Recruitment Module to provide an overview of the potential for
recruitment. Eight life-stage classes have been defined (seedling,
sapling, juvenile, vegetative, budding, flowering, immature fruit,
mature fruit, recently shed) based on the work by Heard and Channon
(1997).</p>
<p><strong>Growth stage (<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/4f0f0ca4-d8f7-472d-9203-f46a565ad970">Recruitment</a> and <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/16a20c3f-e95d-4919-b2d1-a25c7a275109">Condition</a> Modules):</strong>
Growth stage (recruiting, resprouting, mature, senescent, dead) is
recorded within the central 40 x 40 m sub-plot for every perennial
individual present following the Tree survey protocol in the Condition
Module. In addition, a growth stage summary is recorded across the plot
for each species as part of the Recruitment Module. Multiple growth
stages can be recorded for each species. Additionally, recruiting
individuals (seedling, sapling, and juvenile) are counted as part of the
Recruitment Module. Recording growth stage as a measure of condition is
recommended by a number of sources (Gibbons and Freudenberger 2006b,
2006a; Parkes and Lyon 2006; Bleby <em>et al.</em> 2008), as it helps to
characterise the structural diversity of the system (Milne <em>et
al.</em> 2008). Recording growth stage using two methods allows growth
stage to be recorded for every perennial species present and also
provides an estimate for the abundance of each stage.</p>
<p><strong>Seedling, sapling and juvenile counts (<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/4f0f0ca4-d8f7-472d-9203-f46a565ad970">Recruitment Module</a>):</strong> Seedling, sapling and juvenile counts are undertaken
in the central 40 x 40 m sub-plot as part of the Recruitment Module.
Counts are undertaken for an estimate of the number of recruits for the
tree and shrub species present in the system, with counts undertaken on
a per species or per genus basis, where possible (DOC 2019). Recruitment
is an important condition measure because it provides insight into how
well the system is functioning and an indication of the capacity of the
system to regenerate (particularly in degraded systems), and therefore
persist over the long-term (DENR 2011; DEC 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Vegetation health (<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/16a20c3f-e95d-4919-b2d1-a25c7a275109">Condition Module</a>):</strong> Vegetation
health is recorded for every tree and tall shrub present within the 40 x
40 m subplot (excluding seedlings, saplings and juveniles). Health
measures include canopy cover, canopy health (based on an estimate of
damage severity and incidence (Stone <em>et al.</em> 2003), the number
of mistletoes, the presence of any hollows, insect damage and
human-induced damage. Grazing damage is recorded as browse height and
severity. Vegetation health is an important measure of condition, and
several abiotic and biotic factors can contribute to a decline in health
(Department of the Environment 2014). Tree health can serve as a signal
for further investigation, e.g., if high levels of dieback are present
at a site, research into potential causes may be required. High levels
of grazing can result in decline of site condition as it leads to
reduced plant productivity, regenerative capacity, habitat value and
biodiversity, hydrological function and carbon sequestration (Eldridge
and Delgado‐Baquerizo 2017).</p>
<p><strong>Litter depth (<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover Module</a> and <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/16a20c3f-e95d-4919-b2d1-a25c7a275109">Condition Module</a> Modules):</strong> Litter
depth is recorded as an additional measure during the Cover Module
whenever litter is encountered along the four point intercept transects
delineating the sub-plot. Litter depth is the distance between the
mineral soil surface and the top of the litter surface (Hines <em>et
al.</em> 2010). Litter can provide a habitat for some ground-dwelling
fauna and predator invertebrates (McElhinny <em>et al.</em> 2006), a
substrate for the regeneration of plant species (Oliver and Parkes
2003), shelter and food for detritus-feeding invertebrates (Majer <em>et
al.</em> 1997; Oliver and Parkes 2003), and also plays a role in soil
surface stability and can reduce erosion (Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009).
Litter depth information should be used in combination with litter cover
information obtained from the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover Module</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Coarse Woody Debris (<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/0d8b47b4-1ca8-4c76-8329-0eb781a823a2">Coarse Woody Debris Module</a>):</strong>
Coarse woody debris (CWD) is recorded for all logs with a diameter of 10
cm or more within the 40 x 40 m subplot, with the length and diameters
(widest and narrowest) recorded for any pieces present. CWD contributes
to a range of ecosystem processes, including nutrient cycling and
storage, soil formation, stability, and retention, retaining moisture
and enhancing water infiltration, improving thermal conditions, and
providing sites for litter accumulation (Grove and Meggs 2003;
Woldendorp <em>et al.</em> 2004; Manning <em>et al.</em> 2013; Goldin
2020). CWD can also influence fuel loads and fire dynamics (Miehs et al.
2010), and is a preferred habitat feature for a range of fauna,
including shelter, nesting and denning sites for a variety of mammals,
reptiles and some birds (Mac Nally et al. 2001; Threlfall et al.
2021).</p>
<p><strong>Fire (<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/91a54c7c-48ff-402d-a761-ed4fd4ad4a4b">Fire Severity Module</a>):</strong> Fire extent and
severity are determined using transects, with burn distribution,
vegetation char, and scorch height recorded. Fire severity is defined as
the degree of consumption and scorching of live vegetation and dead
fuel, and the degree to which soil properties and processes are altered,
as a result of the combustion process (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005;
Hammill and Bradstock 2006). The cover measurements are indicative of
fire extent and patchiness (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2013), while the
height measurements provide insight into the degree of scorching and
charring of the living and dead vegetation in each strata, which are key
indicators of fire severity (Whight and Bradstock 1999; Hammill and
Bradstock 2006; Russell-Smith and Edwards 2006; Chafer 2008; Edwards
<em>et al.</em> 2013; Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2015). Fire has a major
effect on terrestrial ecosystems and can influence plant diversity,
composition and regeneration, and high frequency burning can result in
the loss of fire sensitive vegetation (Yibarbuk <em>et al.</em> 2001;
Fisher <em>et al.</em> 2009; Etchells <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Vertebrate pest fauna (<a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/8e7c86ce-e283-4cea-aca7-44ed7a22629c">Signs-based Fauna Module</a> and <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/dd2da1e0-edbe-4f20-a1ae-b860876c1837">Herbivory
and Physical Damage Module</a>):</strong> Pest fauna presence will be
recorded at the plot level, with evidence of tracks, scats, warrens,
diggings or other signs/traces recorded (DOE 2013). There will be a
focus on recording evidence of feral cats, foxes, wild dogs, rabbits,
pigs, goats, deer, horses and camels, but other invasive species can
also be included. Pest animals can cause land degradation by promoting
soil erosion and compaction, stream turbidity, the spread of weeds, and
can threaten native plant species and animals through competition,
habitat destruction, over-grazing and predation (Invasive Plants and
Animals Committee 2016). Consequently, the presence of vertebrate pest
fauna can be an indicator of a reduction in condition (Casson <em>et
al.</em> 2009; Pert <em>et al.</em> 2012; Krull <em>et al.</em>
2015).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;

    <h1 id="introduction-and-background">Introduction and Background</h1>
<p>The Condition Module involves the collection of quantitative,
accurate and repeatable measures of condition within the plot, using a
combination of point and plot-based methods. The Condition Module
includes methods for collecting data on plant age class structure, plant
health and size, litter depth, coarse woody debris and recruitment.
Elements of the Coarse Woody Debris Module and Recruitment Module form
part of the Condition Module and data from other modules such as
Floristics, Cover, Fire Severity and Signs-based Fauna Surveys are also
important measures for the overall assessment of condition. The
definition of condition adopted here is revised from the AusPlots Draft
Condition Protocol (Wundke <em>et al.</em> 2015) and is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Biodiversity condition is a measure of the status of the biota at
an assessment site described by key attributes that reflect structure,
function and composition.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Condition Module has been designed to improve consistency and
repeatability in the way condition is measured across Australia and
provide increased opportunities for analysis. The primary aim of the
Condition Module is to collect baseline and revisit data, so any changes
in condition metrics following management interventions can be
evaluated.</p>
<p>Existing frameworks and procedures to assess condition differ in
their approach, and this is reflective of the range of legislative,
management and policy objectives in place, as well as available
resources (Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Methods and protocols for
assessing and monitoring condition have been developed in all states and
territories (Williams 2010), and include BioCondition in Queensland
(Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015), the Biodiversity Assessment Method (BAM) in
New South Wales (DPIE 2020), Habitat Hectare Assessment in Victoria (DSE
2004), TasVeg in Tasmania (Michaels 2006), Bushland Condition Monitoring
(BCM) in South Australia (Milne et al. 2008), Vegetation Condition
Assessment in the Northern Territory (Brocklehurst and Price 2008) and
Native Vegetation Condition Assessment in Western Australia (Casson et
al. 2009). However, the degree these methods have been adopted and
utilised varies between states and territories.</p>
<p>The methods developed by the states and territories have generally
been designed as practical, rapid assessments, appropriate for use by
non-specialists. All have a measure of species composition, plant cover,
life history, weeds and logs (coarse woody debris), and all assess
regeneration or recruitment of canopy or woody species as a measure of
ecosystem function. To measure condition, these methods generally
involve comparison against a reference or benchmark (Williams 2010). The
methods provided here build from the approach developed for the AusPlots
Draft Condition Protocols Manual (Wundke <em>et al.</em> 2015) and align
with existing state and territory methods, where possible.</p>
<p>As more attributes are assessed, the overall picture of biodiversity
condition becomes more comprehensive (Casson <em>et al.</em> 2009).
However, one of the main challenges for developing condition protocols,
is deciding on a set of attributes that are flexible enough to be
applied across Australia, but are also robust, repeatable and cost
effective (NERP National Condition Working Group 2015). The condition
assessment framework presented here, draws on data from a range of
attributes, sourced from a number of the modules, including a core set
from the Condition Module, as well as data from the Recruitment Module,
Coarse Woody Debris Module, Fire Severity Module, Signs-based Fauna
Surveys Module, Floristics Module, and Cover Module. Where required,
condition assessments can also include data from other modules,
including Vertebrate Fauna Module, Invertebrate Fauna Module and Soils
Module.</p>

<h3 id="analysing-condition-data">Analysing condition data</h3>
<p>Condition is generally assessed by measuring a range of features and
then combining these into an index of condition, which is then compared
against a benchmark to generate a condition score (Cook et al. 2010).
Benchmarks are generally based on a pre-European (1750) state, prior to
significant development and disturbance (Thackway et al. 2015), or a
Best on Offer site (BOO, Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2017). Once a set of
benchmarks have been established for a vegetation type, the condition of
any example of that type can be quantified by comparing the site values
with the benchmark values (Parkes <em>et al.</em> 2003; Eyre <em>et
al.</em> 2015). Condition scores can be generated from a mix of field
and remote measures (Eyre et al. 2015; Harwood et al. 2016; Lawley et
al. 2016; McFarlane and Wallace 2019), and to generate condition scores,
primary data is usually converted into an attribute condition score, and
then weighted and aggregated into a single site multi-metric score
(Oliver <em>et al.</em> 2014; Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015). This approach
can be straightforward and easy to understand, and allows a range of
information to be presented as a simple numeric or visual summary (Pert
et al. 2012). However, multi-metric condition scores have two main
shortcomings including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>loss of useful information at the attribute level, and</p></li>
<li><p>generation of similar condition scores for very different sites
through attribute eclipsing - the absence of one attribute being
compensated for by the presence of another (Oliver <em>et al.</em>
2014).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative approach is to assess each condition attribute
individually against a baseline or reference measure. This approach
avoids masking individual attribute scores, which allows a more thorough
understanding of the outcomes of management actions (ESCAVI 2007; Milne
et al. 2008), and as such is the approach recommended here. In addition,
benchmarks are incomplete and lack consistency across Australia and
given these limitations, alternative analysis options are required (Eco
Logical Australia 2013).</p>
<p>The collection of condition data using this protocol is focused on
recording continuous rather than categorial data, as this allows
flexibility when analysing and interpreting data. Collecting data in
this way allows changes in individual attributes to be monitored,
aggregated and analysed to explore a range of issues related to
vegetation condition (Williams 2010). Analysis can be undertaken in a
range of ways or a combination of ways, using the data collected,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Comparison of intervention (treatment) and control plots over
time, against baseline plot measures.</p></li>
<li><p>Generation of benchmarks from suitable nearby reference areas
using the same plot methods, to allow comparison of condition attributes
from intervention or development areas, against relatively unmodified or
best on offer reference areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilisation of state or territory benchmark data and associated
scoring algorithms, where available, to generate condition scores for
the plots studied.</p></li>
<li><p>Generation of a new scoring algorithm using the plot data
collected and benchmark plots, to generate a condition score for each
plot studied (the condition attributes included can be tailored to
project needs and weighted accordingly).</p></li>
