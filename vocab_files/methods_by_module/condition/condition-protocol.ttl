<h2 id="available-protocols">Available Protocols</h2>
<p>The Condition Module includes a Condition attributes protocol, which
provides procedures and guidelines for recording data for a set of core
biodiversity condition attributes, including the growth stage, life
stage, height, diameter at breast height (DBH), health measures (e.g.
dieback, mistletoe, hollows, insect damage) and associated litter depth
of trees and shrubs within the plot.</p>
<p>The module also provides information on other modules/protocols that
should be completed as part of condition monitoring to assess structure,
function and composition, including the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description</a>, <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics</a>,

and visit in the Monitor app.</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/1ff9e97c-3bdd-44c9-bdd3-401fa31c0b32">Plot Description Module</a> – required to place condition monitoring
data in context with the surrounding landform, land surface, vegetation
and disturbance regime.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics Module</a>  – flora species data must be recorded in the
Condition Module using naming consistent with the floristic vouchers
recorded in the Floristics Module. Floristics data also provides
information on the composition of native and introduced plant
species.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Complete concurrently with the Condition Module</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/4f0f0ca4-d8f7-472d-9203-f46a565ad970">Recruitment Module</a> – the Age structure protocol from the
Recruitment Module must be completed as part of condition monitoring.
Seedling, sapling and juvenile counts, combined with tree/shrub
measures, enable a summary of all growth and life stages to be generated
and facilitates an assessment of age class structure.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/0d8b47b4-1ca8-4c76-8329-0eb781a823a2">Coarse Woody Debris Module</a> – must be completed as part of
condition monitoring. Coarse woody debris (CWD) contributes to a range
of ecosystem processes that impact the condition of an
ecosystem.</p></li>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="general">General </h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Partitioning the sub-plot into more manageable units using
existing Cover point-intercept transect tapes, additional tapes and/or
coloured survey pins is highly recommended, particularly in dense
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot boundaries should be marked out according to the existing
method described in the Plot Selection and Layout Module.</p></li>
<li><p>Assessment across the plot is used to document signs of pest
fauna, record fire scar height, and document age class structure, growth
and life-stages, and health of the perennial species present.</p></li>
<li><p>Assessment of fire extent and severity is undertaken in the Fire
Module (which is carried out within the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/c3403517-fcc6-4389-9c09-f1e1ee8b0f3b">Cover Module</a>Cover Module). If a condition

<ul>
<li><p>A tree is considered in the plot if than 50% of the base of the

<li><p>Tree height can be estimated using a forestry rangefinder for
rapid and accurate height measurements. The person entering the data
into the Monitor app can carry the rangefinder on a lanyard over their
shoulder and record tree height when required.</p></li>

<h4 class="unnumbered" id="tree-health">Tree health</h4>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="canopy-cover">Canopy cover</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Canopy cover is assessed as the percentage of foliage missing
from the canopy relative to a reference tree.</p></li>
<li><p>Reference trees can be an archetype of a species with optimal
foliage (absolute reference tree), or a nearby tree with maximum foliage
considering site conditions, altitude, latitude, etc., (local reference)
(Dobbertin 2005; Eichhorn and Roskams 2013).</p></li>
<li><p>Local reference trees are generally best, and a suitable tree is
one that is presumed to be completely healthy (i.e. stress-free), of the
same species, similar age and with maximum foliage (Dobbertin 2005;
Thimonier <em>et al.</em> 2010; Eichhorn <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p></li>
<li><p>Canopy cover is scored in 5% increments, and a healthy tree would
have a canopy cover score of 100% (i.e. 0% defoliation or dieback),
whereas a tree with 25% dieback would have a canopy score of
75%.</p></li>
<li><p>To estimate percentage canopy, visualise a circle around the
outer boundary of the crown. Estimate the proportion of dead crown and
the remainder is the proportion of healthy crown cover (Michaels
2006).</p></li>
<li><p>Epicormic shoots below the crown, absent or fallen branches, and
lower limbs that do not form part of the canopy are not included in
assessable canopy (Michaels 2006; Eichhorn <em>et al.</em>
2020).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="crown-damage-index">Crown Damage Index</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>The incidence and severity of each type of foliage damage
(necrosis, discolouration and defoliation) is also assessed for each
tree (Stone <em>et al.</em> 2003). Incidence (<em>I</em>) is the
percentage of leaves in the canopy affected, and severity (<em>S</em>)
is the percentage of each individual leaf affected. Info buttons will be
provided in the app for easy reference.</p></li>
<li><p>Incidence and severity scores for each type of damage are then
multiplied together and divided by 100 i.e., (<em>I</em> x
<em>S)</em>/100.</p></li>
<li><p>The results for each are then added to produce an overall Crown
Damage Index (CDI).</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, the crown can be divided and the incidence and
severity across all types of damage can be estimated for each portion
and then summed to produce an overall CDI.</p></li>
<li><p>The Crown Damage Index (CDI) is created by visually assessing the
incidence (extent of damage over the entire canopy), and severity
(percentage of each leaf affected), of missing, damaged and discoloured
foliage (Stone <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p></li>
<li><p>There are three types of damage:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Defoliation – where entire leaves or parts of leaves are missing
(Figure A5.1)</p></li>
<li><p>Necrosis – presence of dead leaf tissue (Figure A5.2)</p></li>
<li><p>Discolouration – non-green leaf tissue including yellowing or
reddish-purple discolouration, chlorotic spots or margins (Figure A5.2).
Natural variation of leaf colour needs to be considered when assessing
discolouration, for example <em>Eucalyptus</em> leaves can change colour
as they develop.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="general-guidelines-for-canopy-health">General
guidelines for canopy health</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Although assessments of canopy cover and foliage damage are
subjective, observer bias can be reduced by having the same observer
team for each survey, creating a photo library of local reference trees
with typical canopy morphology, and intercalibrating between observers
and across surveys (Eichhorn and Roskams 2013).</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to observe each tree from several positions,
ideally standing at a distance equal to the height of the tree. An
elevated position ensures a better view.</p></li>
<li><p>Where possible take a closer look at branches, leaves and stems
for signs as to what may be causing the stress symptoms (e.g. galls and
lerps, boreholes etc., are indicative of insect infestation. Appendix 6
provides examples of the types of damage produced by insect and
disease). Binoculars are helpful for looking higher into the canopy. Use
the comments field to add notes regarding potential causes of
damage.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="mistletoe">Mistletoe </h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Walk around the tree to ensure that all mistletoes are identified
and counted correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>Only record living mistletoe.</p></li>
<li><p>Mistletoe abundance generally increases with tree height,
diameter and basal area.</p></li>
<li><p>Trees close to a patch edge or another infested individual are
more likely to host mistletoe (Ward 2005).</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="hollows">Hollows</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Walk around the tree to ensure that all hollows are identified
and counted correctly.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="leaf-litter">Leaf litter </h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Leaf litter is all the plant organic matter above the top layer
of the compacted soil, mostly consisting of decaying and dry leaves
(Moses <em>et al.</em> 2021), but can also include needles, grass, twigs
and bark (Wundke <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p></li>
<li><p>Leaf litter does not include coarse woody debris or woody
debris.</p></li>
<li><p>Push the ruler through the litter until it reaches the soil
surface. The soil surface should be firm.</p></li>
<li><p>Measures of litter depth can have low accuracy (Marimon-Junior
and Hay 2008), so ensure that the light pressure applied until there is
even contact with the litter surface is consistent across sampling
locations.</p></li>
<li><p>If leaf litter measurement device is not available, an equivalent
can be created with a standard 30 cm ruler and a piece of cardboard.
Ensure that the tool used is consistent throughout the survey.</p></li>
<li><p>The same individual should conduct all leaf litter measurements
to reduce error.</p></li>

<h2 id="sample-curation">Sample curation</h2>
<p>No samples are collected directly as part of this module although
vegetation voucher samples (collected with the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/nrm/2b5c2281-e0f4-4ef5-8ae0-8ae745af9a7e">Floristics</a>) will
be used to verify the field identifications used in the components of
this module.</p>
<h1 id="data-submission">Data submission </h1>
<p>Data from the Condition Module is collected in the field using the
Monitor app. Data entry is completed in the app, photos are taken using
the app (or later linked if taken on other devices), and voucher
barcodes are scanned in the app to link voucher numbers to the unique
data. All data is checked for correctness and completeness in the app
before it is submitted.</p>
<p>Once all data is finalised, and marked as completed, the data is
submitted from the Monitor app to the staging server by an explicit user
action. If the device is offline at the time, the data will be pushed as
soon as it is reconnected to a network (i.e. either back in mobile phone
range or a wi-fi network). Once data reaches the staging server it is
prepared in an export interface for delivery to the Biodiversity Data
Repository. DCCEEW is then responsible for managing the data. In the
future, it is anticipated that data curation tools will be made
available to project personnel.</p>
<h1 id="data-use-and-reason-for-collection">Data use and reason for
collection</h1>
<h2 id="future-use-of-the-data">Future use of the data</h2>
<p>Monitoring change in condition is important for NRM projects, as it
enables changes in condition to be tracked following interventions (DOE
2013). Policy demands and expectations have conceptualised vegetation
condition as a major component of native vegetation management,
primarily to assist with decision making for developmental approvals,
incentive payments and market-based investments (Keith and Gorrod 2006;
Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Regional NRM groups are also interested in
vegetation condition, given its listing as a national environmental
indicator for reporting targets (Eyre <em>et al.</em> 2015). The ability
to assess and monitor vegetation condition is also essential for
governments to administer legislation relating to the landscapes and
biodiversity covered by their jurisdiction (Eyre <em>et al.</em>
2015).</p>
<p>The condition attributes collected here can be used to assess changes
in condition (or changes in individual attributes) following
interventions or development. It is likely that these measures could
also be used to monitor changes or recovery following natural
disturbances, such as fires or flooding, or recovery from drought. Data
can also be used to track changes in individual attributes, such as
mistletoe abundance and spread, canopy dieback and DBH size class
distributions. The potential exists for data to contribute to regional,
state of national condition assessments. The collection of reference
data could contribute to nationwide condition databases.</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;

<p><span class="anchor" id="appendix-1"></span>Appendix 1. Assessing
crown damage and calculating the Crown Damage Index (CDI).</p>
<p>The Crown Damage Index (CDI) is created by visually assessing the
incidence (extent of damage over the entire canopy), and severity
(percentage of each leaf affected), of missing, damaged and discoloured
foliage (Stone <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p>
<p>There are three types of damage:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Defoliation – where entire leaves or parts of leaves are missing
(<a href="#figure-3">Figure A1</a>)</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Necrosis – presence of dead leaf tissue (<a href="#figure-4">Figure A2</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Discolouration – non-green leaf tissue including yellowing or
reddish-purple discolouration, chlorotic spots or margins (<a href="#figure-4">Figure A2</a>).
Natural variation of leaf colour needs to be considered when assessing
discolouration, for example eucalyptus leaves can change colour as they
develop.</p></li>
</ol>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="calculating-cdi">Calculating CDI</h5>
<p>CDI is calculated by multiplying, for each type of damage or each
portion of the crown, the incidence (<em>I</em>) by the severity
(<em>S</em>), and then dividing the product by 100. If there are several
types of damage present, or sections of crown affected, these values are
then summed to produce and overall value.</p>
<p>For example, if calculating CDI based on each type of damage present,
imagine a tree where:</p>
<p>50% of leaves are affected by defoliation (<em>S</em> = 50%) with on
average about 30% of individual leaves missing (<em>I</em> = 30%)</p>
<p>+ 20% necrotic damage per leaf (<em>S</em> = 20%) to the lower 15% of
the canopy (<em>I</em> = 15%)</p>
<p>+ 10% of leaves (<em>I</em> = 10%) are discoloured with around 15% of
each leaf affected (<em>S</em> = 15%)</p>
<p>= (50 x 30)/100 + (20 x 15)/100 + (15 x 10)/100 = 15 + 3 + 1.5</p>
<p>CDI = 19.5</p>

<p>Either approach can be used, or a combination of the two approaches
(i.e. each type of damage for sections of the crown). The default in the
