<p>
  Each of the field measures described in this manual, inform on attributes
  which describe biodiversity condition. The Condition module consists of a set
  of core condition measures, in combination with measures from the Recruitment,
  Coarse woody debris and Fire modules, which in combination form the condition
  set of protocols. The results from other modules, including Floristics and
  Cover also feed into condition assessments. This protocol includes
  step-by-step instructions for the core set of condition measures. Refer to the
  Recruitment, Coarse woody debris and Fire modules for survey guidelines for
  these measures.
</p>
<p>There are five main field components to underpin the condition measures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Condition point-intercept: Used to collect the condition point-intercept
    measures using four point-intercept transects (hashtag method), aligned with
    a subset of the existing plot layout described in the Cover module.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sub-plot assessment: large tree counts and age class structure assessment
    using a central 40 x 40 m subplot, defined by the boundaries of the
    condition point-intercept transects.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plot assessment (visual assessment): Growth-stage and life-stage information
    will be recorded for any perennial species present in the plot. Any evidence
    of vertebrate pests will also be recorded at the plot level. A visual
    assessment of the highest burn point at the site to describe fire intensity
    will be undertaken following the completion of the condition point-intercept
    transect.
  </li>
  <li>
    Line transects: Line-intercept transects will be used to assess the size and
    quantity of coarse woody debris. The assessment will include 3 x 100 m
    transects running north-south and 3 x 100 m transects running east-west (6
    in total), aligned with the existing plot layout described in the Cover
    module.
  </li>
  <li>
    Belt transect: Belt transects, which align with a subset (5 N/S) of the
    existing transects described in the Cover module are used for seedling and
    sapling counts, and the small tree survey.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Condition module is linked to the following modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Plot selection and layout – The plot selection module needs to be undertaken
    before any condition surveys can take place. Plot selection should consider
    control and impact sites, and where necessary the inclusion of benchmark
    plots.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plot description – Disturbance information collected as part of the plot
    description module can be used to supplement condition data and help provide
    a more complete description of condition.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cover – The Condition module uses a subset of the point-intercept transects
    established during the cover module. Condition assessments should be
    completed after cover to make use of the tapes that have already been set
    up. The results of the cover module feed into the overall condition
    assessments and analysis and provide information about native and weed
    cover.
  </li>
  <li>
    Floristics – The Floristics module needs to be completed before the
    condition point-intercept, recruitment belt-transects, and growth and
    life-stage assessments are undertaken. Information can only be entered
    against species (or field names) recorded during the floristics module. The
    results from the floristics module provide information on the diversity of
    native and weed plant species, which are important condition measures.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recruitment – Sections of the Recruitment module need to be completed as
    part of the condition assessment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Coarse woody debris – The Coarse woody debris module needs to be completed
    as part of the condition assessment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fire – Sections of the Fire module need to be completed as part of the
    condition assessment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Interventions – Condition assessments should be undertaken before and after
    any interventions occur. The condition protocol is focused predominantly in
    assessing changes in condition following on-ground interventions. It is
    recommended that condition assessments are undertaken in impact
    (intervention) and control sites.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>General Overview</strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Assessment should be undertaken at suitable time(s) of year to ensure
    species are detectable (e.g., annual herbs) and identifiable (e.g.,
    grasses). Repeat visits should be undertaken at the same time(s) as the
    baseline assessments.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plot boundaries will be marked out according to the existing method
    described in the Plot Selection and Layout module. For the purposes of the
    condition point-intercept, four 100 m transects are then marked on the 30 m
    and 70 m transect lines, both in the north-south and east- west orientation
    as shown below.
  </li>
  <li>
    The 40 x 40 m subplot is defined by the central area (30-70 m) within the
    four-condition point- intercept transects.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assessment across the plot is used to document signs of pest animals, record
    fire scar height, and document growth and life-stages of the perennial
    species present.
  </li>
  <li>
    CWD assessments occur across 6 transects (although survey design variations
    exist), with 3 transects running N/S and 3 E/W.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recruitment is measured using narrow belt transects (2 m wide), that align
    with the transects established in the Cover module. The belt transect
    boundary is defined using the point-intercept staff and does not require any
    further tapes to be laid out.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assessment of fire extent and severity is undertaken as part of the Cover
    module. If a condition survey is to be undertaken, ensure that the fire
    option has been activated in the Cover module.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  <strong
    >Parts from the following modules needs to be undertaken as part of the
    condition assessment:</strong
  >
</p>
<p style="color: orange">Recruitment</p>
<ul>
  <li>Growth stage</li>
  <li>Life-stage</li>
  <li>Seedling and sapling count</li>
  <li>Small tree survey</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: orange">Coarse woody debris</p>
<p>
  The Coarse woody debris module needs to be completed as part of the condition
  assessment.
</p>
<p style="color: orange">Fire</p>
<p>
  The Fire module needs to be completed as part of the condition assessment.
  Fire extent and severity data collected using the point-intercept should be
  collected at the same time as Cover. If condition is being assessed, ensure
  that the fire option has been activated in the Cover module. The following
  measures from the Fire module also need to be recorded:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scorch height</li>
  <li>Char depth</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional guidelines</h2>
<h5>Preparation</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    Before commencing any fieldwork, review the NVIS mapping for the site and
    determine what major vegetation groups (MVGs) are present.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure you are familiar with the MVGs likely to be present as the threshold
    DBH size for the large tree survey is determined by MVGs.
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>General field collection</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    The preferred time to sample vegetation will vary with location and
    vegetation type, but the following can be used as a guide (Eco Logical
    Australia 2013):
    <ul>
      <li>--North of the Tropic of Capricorn - April to June</li>
      <li>--All other parts of NT, QLD, WA and SA - August to November</li>
      <li>--Northern NSW (north of Newcastle) - September to November</li>
      <li>
        --ACT, VIC, and southern NSW (other than alpine zones) - October to
        December
      </li>
      <li>--Mainland alpine zones and TAS - November to January</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The time of the year in which the assessment is done can influence the
    outcomes of the survey. For example, assessing health at the end of the hot,
    dry, season, can also be useful as this reflects peak stress (Casson et al.
    2009), and therefore multiple assessments can be beneficial to assess
    condition, depending on project aims.
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid sampling immediately after extreme events such as bushfires, cyclones
    or floods, as these will cause anomalies in the data (Eco Logical Australia
    2013), unless recovery following disturbance is the focus of the project.
  </li>
  <li>
    A single field visit may miss key events that have an influence on condition
    (Casson et al. 2009), so multiple visits per year should be considered,
    although they will not be necessary for every project.
  </li>
  <li>
    At a minimum, surveys should be undertaken before any interventions (or
    development) are carried out and again at the end of the project but can
    also be repeated yearly or seasonally depending on the project needs
    (Commonwealth of Australia 2013).
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeated sampling of field plots over time will provide the capacity to
    inform on changes in condition following interventions (Eco Logical
    Australia 2013) or development. Repeat visits should be undertaken at the
    same time(s) each year.
  </li>
  <li>
    Setting up multiple control, treatment and baseline plots (optional) can
    help track changes in condition resulting from interventions or development
    and separate these changes from natural fluctuations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Treatment plots should be in (on near) areas where the intervention or
    development will be carried out. Control plots should be located nearby to
    treatment plots, in comparable vegetation, but where no intervention will be
    carried out or away from any developments (Eco Logical Australia 2013).
  </li>
  <li>
    If the project involves a range of intervention activities, then survey
    plots should be representative of these activities (Commonwealth of
    Australia 2013).
  </li>
  <li>
    If being used, baseline plots can be located up to 10 km from the project
    site, if the vegetation type is the same (Eco Logical Australia 2013).
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Litter depth</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    Leaf litter is all the plant organic matter above the top layer of the
    compacted soil, mostly consisting of decaying and dry leaves (Moses et al.
    2021), but can also include needles, grass, twigs and bark (Wundke et al.
    2015).
  </li>
  <li>
    Push the ruler through the litter until it reaches the soil surface. The
    soil surface should be firm.
  </li>
  <li>
    Measures of litter depth can have low accuracy (Marimon-Junior and Hay
    2008), so ensure that the light pressure applied until there is even contact
    with the litter surface is consistent across sampling locations.
  </li>
  <li>Record litter depth in mm (see figures for more information).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Plant health</h5>
<p>Canopy health</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Canopy health (percent canopy) needs to be recorded for every individual
    intercepted (refer to the supporting information for guidelines and
    examples).
  </li>
  <li>
    To estimate percent canopy, visualise a circle around the outer boundary of
    the canopy crown. If all branches are bearing foliage, record as 100%.
    Estimate the proportion of dead crown, the remainder is the proportion of
    healthy crown cover (Michaels 2006).
  </li>
  <li>
    Effectively, this is a measure of how far the small leaf bearing branches
    that make up the canopy are from maximum foliage carrying capacity (Michaels
    2006).
  </li>
  <li>
    Dead individuals have a canopy health value of 0%. No other health values
    need to be recorded for dead trees.
  </li>
  <li>
    See figures for more information about undertaking a visual assessment of
    canopy health.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Mistletoe</p>
<ul>
  <li>Only count the number of live mistletoes.</li>
  <li>
    If there are several mistletoes in the canopy of one individual, and they
    are difficult to distinguish, walk around the plant to ensure that all
    mistletoes are identified, and the number is counted correctly.
  </li>
  <li>Refer to Appendix 6 for an example of determining mistletoe number.</li>
  <li>
    Mistletoe abundance generally increases with tree height, diameter and basal
    area.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trees close to a patch edge, or another infested individual are more likely
    to host mistletoe (Ward 2005).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Epicormic growth</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Individuals that have suffered stress often produce epicormic shoots along
    their branches or trunk.
  </li>
  <li>Epicormic growth can also be a common post-fire response.</li>
  <li>
    The degree of epicormic growth can be measured as the proportion of canopy
    foliage consisting of epicormic growth (Ward 2005).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Insects and disease</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Insect damage can involve galls or lerps, herbivory, leaf and shoot
    distortion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Galls are growths on leaves or stems, while lerps are characterized by
    deposition of waxy or sugary material on the leaf or stem surface.
  </li>
  <li>
    Insects can also cause curled and distorted leaves and shoots (see figures
    below).
  </li>
  <li>
    Disease can result in leaf discoloration, crown and shoot dieback,
    defoliation and plant death (Carnegie 2007).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Grazing</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Level of grazing and the species grazed can give an indication of the level
    of utilisation (Native Vegetation Council 2017).
  </li>
  <li>
    Grazing can be identified by removal or pruning of leaves, stems and
    branches.
  </li>
  <li>
    Grazing can result in most of the plant being restricted to areas that are
    difficult to access (i.e., &gt;2 m tall).
  </li>
  <li>
    Additional information about grazing can be recorded in the comments field,
    including information about browse line height.
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Age Class Survey</h5>
<p>DBH size class survey</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Subdividing the plot into smaller areas or marking stems once they have been
    counted can help to ensure that individuals are not missed or recorded
    multiple times.
  </li>
  <li>
    Measure the diameter at 1.3 m. If individuals are less than 1.3 m tall, they
    do not need to be measured.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trees and shrubs can be marked with non-permanent chalk paint (or flagging
    tape/survey pegs) to avoid measuring everyone more than once.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a diameter tape or tape measure to check diameters to ensure data is
    added to the appropriate age class.
  </li>
  <li>
    The large tree survey can be undertaken at the same time as the age class
    structure. If an individual meets the DBH side threshold, tally the
    individual as part of the size class survey and then toggle to the large
    tree survey screen to complete all the required fields.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Large tree survey</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Subdividing the plot into smaller areas or marking stems once they have been
    counted can help to ensure that individuals are not missed or recorded
    multiple times.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there are several large trees within the sub-plot, mark with marking
    chalk paint (or flagging tape or survey pegs) to avoid measuring each
    individual more than once.
  </li>
  <li>
    Large trees should be recorded to the species level and the number of large
    trees tallied on a per species basis.
  </li>
  <li>
    If it is not possible to identify some individuals to the species level,
    data can be recorded at the genus level (or assigned to a field name).
    Information can only be collected against species (and associated genus) or
    field names sampled during the Floristics module.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a diameter tape or tape measure to check tree diameter and ensure it
    meets the size thresholds.
  </li>
  <li>Measure the diameter at 1.3 m.</li>
  <li>
    Refer to the supporting information for details on how to measure DBH for
    problem trees.
  </li>
  <li>For multi-stemmed trees, measure the DBH of every main trunk.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Pest animals</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    The pest animal survey is designed to be a rapid survey that records pest
    animal presence but not abundance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Record any evidence of pest animals across the 1 ha plot, using the
    drop-down list within the app. Multiple evidence types can be selected for
    each pest fauna type.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the comments field to record any other details that may be useful for
    the project or for the interpretation of other datasets, such as if pest
    signs are abundant in a specific area or the plot or if there is evidence of
    damage or overgrazing to the vegetation.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Image examples</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Examples of resprouting, including basal, epicormic (trunk), basal and
    epicormic and epicormic (crown) resprouting.
