    The condition point-intercept requires four 100 m transects, which align
    with the 30 m and 70 m N/S and E/W Cover transects (Figure 2). For each
    transect lay out a 100 m tape between the start and end points/pegs. Ensure
    the tape is orientated to align with the grid, straight, and on the ground
    (where possible) and not draped over shrubs.

  <li>
    Record your starting point from the drop-down list (i.e., N2, N4, S2, S4,
    E2, E4, W2 or W4). This records the transect you are on and the direction
    you are travelling in (e.g., ‘N2’ means you are travelling south on the
    N2/S2 transect, while ‘S4’ means you are travelling north on the N4/S4
    transect, etc.).
  </li>
  <li>
    Using a staff with laser pointer mounted on the pole at a height of 1.5 m
    and densitometer at the top of the pole (for plots with upper story), start
    at the 0 m mark of the first transect. Place the bottom of the staff at the
    0 m mark, ensure the staff is vertical and the laser pointer is pointing
    downwards, and the track of the laser pointer is parallel with the direction
    of the transect.
  </li>
  <li>
    Move to the 0 m mark of the first transect you wish to complete. It does not
    matter which order, or which direction each transect is completed, as your
    start position will be recorded in Step 3.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press the button on the laser pointer to determine presence of leaf litter
    at the point of contact of the laser beam and the substrate surface. If
    litter is intercepted, select the Litter button and measure litter depth in
    mm (see Litter depth section below). Refer to the Cover module for more
    detailed information about the point-intercept method.
  </li>
  <li>
    Next record any trees or shrubs that are intercepted with the laser pointer
    or touching the staff between the laser pointer and the densitometer. Record
    species, growth stage, and vegetation health.
  </li>
  <li>
    The densitometer is used to view canopy intercepts (i.e., intercepts taller
    than the densitometer). Look through the densitometer to determine whether
    any portion of a tree or shrub crown intersects the vertical line of sight
    through the densitometer. The vertical line of sight is obtained by
    levelling both densitometer bubble-levels and then sighting through the
    instrument so that the sighting marks are aligned (crosshairs/circle in the
    far lens is at the center of the circle in the near lens). If foliage or
    branches are sighted in the cross hairs, follow the procedures to record
    species, growth stage and vegetation health (see Growth stage measures and
    Vegetation health sections below).
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue recording the same information (as per points 6 to 8) at each 1 m
    interval along each of the 4 transects. This will give a total of 404 points
    for each plot (ii.e.4 transects x 101 points per transect).

  <p>Growth stage measure</p>
  <li>
    When a perennial plant species (tree or shrub) is intercepted (by the laser
    pointer, staff or densitometer), growth stage is recorded in the following
    way:
  </li>
  <ol>
    <li>
      If an individual plant has previously had growth stage recorded, do not
      assess the plant and record as ‘repeat’.
    </li>
    <li>Record the species name.</li>
    <li>
      Visually assess the plant according to the descriptions in the table below
      and assign a growth stage code (also see figures below).
    </li>
    <li>Visually assess plant height (m) (a rangefinder can be used).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Vegetation health</p>
  <li>
    When a tree or shrub is intercepted, vegetation health is recorded in the
    following way:
  </li>
  <ol>
    <li>
      If an individual plant has previously been assessed for vegetation health,
      do not assess the plant and record as ‘repeat’.
    </li>
    <li>
      Conduct a visual assessment of the plant for presence of factors affecting
      vegetation health, detailed in Table (see figure for more information and
      examples of the plant health factors).
    </li>
    <li>
      Record the presence of the health factors in Table, by using the check
      boxes. Multiple boxes can be checked. Canopy health needs to be recorded
      for every individual surveyed, with the percent of healthy canopy entered.
      If present, the number of mistletoes need to be recorded.
    </li>
    <li>
      Take a photo of the individual to document health factors (optional) and
      record any additional information in the comments field (optional).
