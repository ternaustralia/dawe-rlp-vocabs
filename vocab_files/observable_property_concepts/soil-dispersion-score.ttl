    skos:definition "Characteristics of soils relating to their structural breakdown into individual particles in water. Usually associated with high levels of exchangeable sodium on the clay fraction and low levels of soluble salts in the soil. These factors cause clay particles to separate in water. As clay is one of the chief agents holding soil materials together, this leads to collapse of the soil structure and consequent instability. Soil field dispersion score can range anywhere between 0 - 4 (see Appendix CC in soil module)." ;
