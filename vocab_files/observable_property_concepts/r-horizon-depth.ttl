    skos:definition "The R horizon refers to the layer of soil that is made up of mostly solid rock with little or no soil development. This layer is typically located at the very bottom of the soil profile, beneath the A, B, and C horizons. The depth of the R horizon can vary depending on the location and geology of the area. It is a zone of bare rock, weathering rock, and saprolite that may show little evidence of soil formation." ;
