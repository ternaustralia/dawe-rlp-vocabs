    skos:definition "The expected number of trap nights is a measure of the amount of effort that is put into a trapping study. It is calculated by multiplying the number of traps that are set out in a particular area by the number of nights that the traps are left out. For example, if 10 traps are set out in a particular area and they are left out for 5 nights, the expected number of trap nights would be 50." ;
