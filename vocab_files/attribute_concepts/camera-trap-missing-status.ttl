    skos:definition "The missing status of the camera traps during recovery. The 'missing status' of a camera trap refers to the fact that the camera may not capture images or videos of all animals present in an area. This can occur for a variety of reasons, including the animals being too small or too fast for the camera to detect, the animals being too far away from the camera, or the animals simply not being in the field of view of the camera." ;
